- en: So I'm excited to talk today about our recent work on using Transers for reinforcement
    learning and this is joint work with a bunch of really exciting collaborators。most
    of them at UC Berkeley and some of them at Facebook and Google。I should mention
    this work was led by way to talented undergrads， Li Chen and Kevin Blue。![](img/041a2ae7aae080f075f80cd7c4c33a68_2.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm excited to present the results we had， so let's try to motivate why
    we even care about this problem。So we have seen in the last。Three or four years，
    that transformers since the introduction in 2017 have taken over lots and lots
    of different fields of artificial intelligence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we saw them having a big impact for language processing， we saw them being
    used for vision。the vision transformer very recently they were in nature trying
    to solve protein folding and very soon they might just replace as computer scientists
    by having automatically generate code。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So with all of these advances， it seems like we are getting closer to having
    a unified model for decision making for artificial intelligence。But artificial
    intelligence is much more about not just having perception。but also using the
    perception knowledge to make decisions。And this is what this talk is going to
    be about。But before I go into actually thinking about how we will use these models
    decision making。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here is a motivation for why I think it is important to ask this question。So
    unlike models for RL。when we look at transformers for perception modalities like
    I showed in the previous slide。we find that these models are very scalable and
    have very stable training dynamics so you can keep as long as you have enough
    computation and you have more and more data that can be sourced。you can train
    bigger and bigger models and you'll see very smooth reductions in the loss。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the overall training dynamics are very stable， and this makes it very easy
    for practitioners and researchers to build these models and learn richer and richer
    distributions。So like I said， all of these advances have so far occurred in perception
    what we've been interested in this talk is to think about how we can go from perception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking at images， looking at text and all these kinds of sensory signals to
    then going into the field of actually taking actions and making our agents do
    interesting things in the world。😊，啊。And here throughout the talk， we should be
    thinking about why this perspective is going to enable us to do scalable learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like I showed on the previous slide， as well as brings stability into the whole
    procedure。😊。So sequential decision making is a very broad area and what I'm specifically
    going to be focusing on today is the one route to sequential decision making that's
    reinforcement learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So just as a brief background， what is reinforcement learning。so we are given
    an agent who' is in a current state and the agent is going to interact with the
    environment by taking actions。And by taking these actions， the environment is
    going to return to it a reward。For how good that action was as well as next state
    into which the agent will transition and this whole feedback loop will continue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 啊。The goal here for an intelligent agent is to then using trial and error。so
    try out different actions， see what rewards will lead to learn a policy which
    maps your states to actions such that the policy maximizes the agent's cumulative
    rewards over time horizon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you take a sequence of actions and then based on the reward you accumulate
    for that sequence of actions。will' judge how good your policy is。This talk is
    also going to be specifically focused on a form of reinforcement learning that
    goes by the name of offline reinforcement learning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the idea here is that what changes from the previous picture where I was
    talking about online learning。online reinforcement learning is that here now instead
    of doing actively interacting with the environment。you have a collection of log
    data of interactions so think about some robot that's going out in the fields
    and it collects a bunch of sensory data and you have all logged it and using that
    log data you now want to train another agent。it could be another robot to then
    learn something interesting about that environment just by looking at the log
    data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: G so theres no trial and error component。Which is currently one of the extensions
    of this framework。which would be very exciting， so I'll talk about this towards
    the end of the talk why it's exciting to think about how we can extend this framework
    to include an exploration component and have trial and error。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， so not to go more concretely into what the motivating challenge of the
    stock was now that they have introduced ArL。so let's look at some statistics。So
    large language models。I have billions of parameters and they have today they have
    roughly about 100 layers in Transformer。they are very stable to train using supervised
    learning， style losses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which are the building blocks of autoregressive generation， for instance。or
    for mass language modeling as in B。And this is like a field that's growing every
    day and there's a course on it at Stanford that we're all taking just because
    it has had such a monumental impact on AI。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 嗯。RL policies， on the other hand， and I'm talking about deep RL。the maximum
    they would extend to is maybe millions of parameters at 20 layers。嗯。And what's
    really unnerving is that they're very unstable to train so the current algorithms
    for reinforcement learning they build on mostly dynamic programming which involves
    solving an inter loop optimization problem that's very unstable and it's very
    common to see practitioners in RL looking at reward reward code that look like
    this so what I really want you to see here is the variance in the returns that
    we tend to get in RL it's really huge even after doing multiple rounds of experimentation
    and that's often that is really at the code got to done with the fact that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our algorithms learning checks need better improvements so that the performance
    can be stably achieved by Asians。In complex environments。So what this work is
    hoping to do is it's meant to introduce transformers。And I'll first show in one
    slide what exactly that model looks like and we're going to go into deeper details
    of each of the components。I have good question。Yeah， I can ask a question real
    quick。Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and thank you what I'm curious to know is is the what is the cause for why RL
    typically has several orders of magnitude fewer parameters？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a great question， so typically when you think about reinforcement learning
    algorithms。😊。In deep art in particular， so the most common algorithms， for example。have
    different networks playing different roles in the task so you'll have a network
    for instance。playing the role of an actor so trying to figure out a policy and
    then therell a different network that's playing the role of a critic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these networks are trained on data that's adaptively gathered so unlike
    perception where you will have a huge data set of interactions on which you can
    train your models in this case the architectures and even the environments to
    some extent。are very simplistic because of the fact that we are trying to train
    very small components the functions that we're training and then bringing them
    all together and these functions are often trained in not super complex environments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it's a mix of different issues I wouldn't say it's purely just got to with
    the fact that the learning objectives are fault。but it's a combination of the
    environments we use the combination of the targets that each of the neural networks
    are predicting which leads to networks which are much bigger than。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we currently see tending to or， and that's why it's very common to see
    neural networks with much fewer layers being used in RL as opposed to perception。Thank
    you。You want to ask a questionep yeah， I was going to is there a reason why you
    chose offline RL versus online RL？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's another great question so the question is why offline R is opposed to
    online RL and the plain reason is because all this is a first work trying to look
    at reinforcement learning so offline RL avoids this problem of exploration。You
    are given a log data set of interactions you're not allowed to further interact
    with the environment so just from this data set you're trying to unearth a policy
    of what the optimal agent would look like so it would right like if you do online
    RL wouldn't that like just give you this opportunity of exploration basically
    it would it would what would also do which is a technically challenging here is
    that the exploration would be harder to encode so offline R is the first step
    there is no reason why we should not study why online RL cannot be done it's just
    that it provides a more contained setup where ideas from transformers will directly
    extend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， sounds good， so let's look at the model and it's really simple on purpose。So
    what we're going to do is we're going to look at our offline data。which is essentially
    in the form of tra trees， so offline data would look like a sequence of states。actions，
    returns over multiple time steps。It's a sequence that's natural to think of us
    as directly feeding as input to a transformer in this case we use a causal transformer
    as it's common in GPT。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we go from left to right and because the data set comes with the notion of
    time step causality here is much more well intended than the general meaning that's
    used for perception this is really causality how it should be in perspective of
    time。What we predict out of this transformer are the actions conditioned on everything
    that comes before that token in the sequence。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you want to predict the action at this t minus one step， we'll use everything
    that came。At time step D minus two， as well as the returns and states at time
    step D minus one。Okay。So we will go into the details of how exactly each of these
    are encoded。but essentially this is in a one liner， it's taking the tragic pre
    datata from the offline data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: treating it as a sequence of tokens， passing it through a causal transformer
    and getting a sequence of actions as the output。Okay， so how exactly do we do
    the forward path through the network？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So one important aspect of this work， which is the U states' actions and this
    quantity called returns to room。So these are not direct rewards。These are returns
    to go and let's see what they really mean。So this is a trajectory that goes as
    input。and the returns to go are the sum of rewards starting from the current time
    step into until the end of the episode。So really what we want the transformer
    is to get better at using a target return。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is how you should think of returns to go。As the input in deciding what
    action to take。This perspective is going to have multiple advantages if it willll
    allow us to actually do much more than offline RL and generalizing to different
    tasks by just changing the returns to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here it's very important， so at time step one we will just have the overall
    sum of rewards for the entire tragic dream at time step two we subtract the reward
    we get by taking the first action and then have the sum of rewards for the remainder
    of the tragic dream。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， so that's how we quality turns to go like how many more rewards in accumulation
    you need to acquire to fulfill your。Re your return goal that is set the beginning。What
    is the output。the output is the sequence of predicted actions， so as I showed
    in the previous slide。we use a causal transformer so we predict in sequence the
    desired actions。The attention， which is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going to be computed inside the transformer with taking an important hyperparameter
    key。which is the context length。We see that in perception as well here， and for
    the rest of the talk。I'm going to use the notation K to denote how many tokens
    in the past would we be attending over to predict the action and the current time
    step。Okay， so again， digging a little bit deeper into code。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some subtle differences with how a decision transformer operates as
    opposed to a normal transformer。the first is that here the time step notion is
    going to be。哦。Have a much bigger semantics that extends across three tokens。So
    in perception。you just think about the time step per word， for instance， like
    in NLP or per patch for vision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in this case we will have a time step encapsulating three tokens， one for
    the states。one for the actions and one for the rewards。And then we embed each
    of these tokens and then add the pollution embedding as it common in the transformer
    and we feed those inputs to the transformer at the output we only care about one
    of these fee tokens in those default side I will say experiments where even the
    other tokens might be of interest as target predictions but for now let's keep
    it simple。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to learn a policy a policy which is trying to predict actions。So when
    we try to decode。we'll only be looking at the actions from the hidden representation
    in the prefin layer。Okay。so this is the forward pass now what do we do with this
    network， we train it how do we train it？😊。Sorry， just a quick question on semantics
    there if you go back one slide。The plus in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the syntax means that you are actually adding the values element wise and not
    concatenating them。is that right？That is correct。公。Okay， so what's the last function
    follow up on that。I thought it was concot， why are we just adding it？Sorry， can
    you go back？Yeah。I think it's a design choice， you can pattern in it， you can
    add it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it leads to different functions being encoded in our case it was editioned。O。Why
    did you try the other one and it just didn't work or why is that because I think
    intuitively concatenating would like make more sense。So I think both of them have
    different use cases for the functional of encoding like one is really mixing in
    the embeddings for the state and basically shifting it so and you add something
    if you think of the embedding of the states as a vector and you add something
    you are actually shifting it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas in the concatetnation case， you are actually increasing the dimensionality
    of this space。😊。Yeah呀。So those are different choices which are doing very different
    things we found this one to be worked better i'm not sure I remember if the results
    was very significantly different if you would concatetnate them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but this is the one which we operate with。But wouldn't there because like if
    you're shifting it right like if you have an em bedding for a state and let's
    say like you perform certain actions and you like end up at the same state again。You
    would want these embeddings to be the same however now you're at a different time
    step so like you shifted it so wouldn't that be like harder to learn？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's a bigger and interesting question in that what you said is basically。are
    we losing the Marco property？Because as you said that if we come back to the same
    state at a different time step。shouldn't we be doing similar operations and the
    answer here is yes， we are actually being nonmarco。And this might seem very nonintuitive
    at first that why is nonmarkovness important here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I want to refer to another paper which came very much in conjunction with
    this a transer that actually shows in more detail and its basically says that
    if you were trying to predict the transition dynamics。then you could have actually
    had a Markovvian system built in here， which would do just as good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However， for the perspective of trying to actually predict actions。it does help
    to look at the previous time steps， even more so when you have missing observations
    so for instance。if you have the observations being a subset of the true state
    so looking at the previous states and actions helps you better fill in the missing
    pieces in some sense so this is commonly known as partial observability where
    you by looking at the previous tokens you can do a better job at predicting the
    actions that you should take at the current time step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So nonmarkness is on purpose， and it's non intuitive。but I think it's one of
    the things that separates this framework from existing ones。So it will basically
    help you because like RL usually works on like infinite like works better on like
    infinite horizon problems right so technically the way you formulated it it would
    work better on finite horizon problems I'm assuming because you want to take different
    actions based on like a history based on like given the fact that now you have
    to a different time step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah yeah so if you wanted to work on In Verorizon maybe something like discounting
    would work just as well to get that effect in this case we were using a discount
    factor of one or basically like no discounting at all。but you're right if I think
    we really want to extend it to In horizonizon you would need to change the discount
    factor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thanks。Okay， so questions。Oh。I think it was just answered in chat， but I'll
    ask it anyways。I think I might have missed this or maybe you're about to talk
    about it。the offline data that was collected， what policy was used to collect
    it。So this is a very important question and it will be something I mentioned the
    experiments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we were using the benchmarks that exist for our scenario where essentially
    the way these benchmarks are constructed as。You train an agent using online RL
    and then you look at its replay buffer at some time step。So while training so
    while it's like a medium sort of expert。you collect it the transition its' experience
    so far and make that as the offline data' it's something which is like our framework
    is very agnostic to what offline data that you use so I've not discussed so far
    but make something that in our experiments is based on traditional benchmarks
    got it so the reason I ask isn't I'm sure that your framework can accommodate
    any offline data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it seems to me like the results that you're about to present are going to
    be heavily contingent on what that that data collection policy is。Indeed， indeed，
    and also so we will， I think I have a slide where we show an experiment where
    the amount of data can make a difference in how we compare with baselines and
    essentially we will see how distant transformer especially shines when there is
    small amounts of offline data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 知道。Okay， cool。thank you。Okay great questions so let let's go ahead so we have
    defined our model which is going to look at these tra trees and now let's see
    how we train it so very simple we are trying to fill actions。we'll try to match
    them to the ones we have in our data set if they are continuous using the mean
    square error if they are discrete and we can use across entropy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，Um。But there is something very deep in here for our research。which is that
    these objectives are very stable to train and easily regularize because they've
    been developed for supervised learning。In contrast， what R is more used to is
    dynamic programming。style objectives which are based on the Belman equation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And those end up being much harder to optimize and scale。and that's why you
    see a lot of the variance in the results as well。Okay so this is how we train
    the model now how do we use the model and that's the point about trying to do
    rollouts for the model so here again this is going to be similar to doing an autoregressive
    generation there was an important token here which was the returns to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what we need to set during evaluation， presumably we want export level performance
    because that will have the highest returns。so we set the initial returns to go。Not
    based on a tragic tree because now we don't have a tragic tree we're going to
    generate a tragic tree so this is at entrance time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we will set it to the expatory term for instance。So in code what this whole
    procedure would look like is basically you set this returns to go token to as
    some target return and you set your initial state to one from the environment
    distribution of initial states。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then you just roll out your decision transformer。So you get a new action。this
    action will also give you a state and reward from the environment。you append them
    to your sequence and you get a new returns to go and you take just the context
    and key because that's what's used by the transformer to making predictions and
    then field it back to the distant transformer。So it's regular auto regressive
    generation， but the only key point to notice is how you initialize the transformer
    for RL。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So add one question here。So how much is it choice on the expert target written
    method。is it does it have to be like the mean expert reward or can it be like
    the maximum reward possible in demand？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，Like， does that try of the number really matter？That's a very good question。so
    we generally would set it to be slightly higher than the max return in the data
    so I think the fact that we use was 1。1 times， but I think we have done a lot
    of experimentation in the range and it's fairly robust to what choice you use。So
    for example， for hopper export returns about 3600 and we have found very stable
    performance from all the way from like 30。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5400 to even going to very high numbers like 5000 it works。嗯。Yeah， so however。I
    would want to point out that this is something which is not typically needed in
    regular RL like knowing the exposure return here we are actually going beyond
    regular Rl and that we can choose a return we want so we also actually need this
    information about what the exposure return is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At that point。Thanks。There's another question。Yes， so yeah， it' just you。you
    cannot be on the regular oil， but I'm curious about。Do you also like restrict
    this framework to only offline oil cost。If you wanna run this kind of framework
    in online oil。you'll have to determine the returns to go a priorary。 So this kind
    of framework。I think is kind of restricted to only offline oil。 Do you think so。Yes。and
    I think asking this question as well earlier that yes， I think for now this is
    the first work。so we were focusing on offline Rs where this information can be
    gathered from the offline data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 啊。It is possible to think about strategies on how you can even get this online
    what you'll need is a curriculum so early on during training as you're gathering
    data。You will set when you're doing rollouts， you will set your export return
    to whatever you see in the data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then incremented as when we start seeing that the transformer can actually
    exceed that performance。So you can think of specifying a curriculum from slow
    to high for what that export return could be for Biitzitchu rollout。Chs the the
    decision transforming。I say cool。 Thank you。So yeah， this was about the model。so
    we discussed how this model is， what the input to these model are， what the outputs
    are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what the loss function is used for training this model， and how do we use this
    model at test time。There is a connection to this framework as being one way to
    instantiate what is often known as all as probabilistic inference。So we can formulate
    RL as a graphical model problem where you have these states and actions being
    used to determine what the next state is。And to encode a notion of optimality，
    typically you would also have these additional a variables， 01。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 02 and so on forth， which are implicitly saying that encoding some notion of
    reward。and conditioned on this optimality being true， RL is the task of learning
    a policy。which is the mapping from states to actions such that we get optimal
    behavior。And if you really squint your eyes， you can see that these optimality
    variables and decision transformers are actually being encoded by the returns
    to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So if then we give。A value that's high enough at this time during rollouts
    like the expert return。we are essentially saying that conditioned on this being。The
    mathematical form of quantification of optimality。Roll out your listen transformer
    to hopefully satisfy this condition。So。Yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so this was all I want to talk about the model' can you explain that， please？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you mean by optimality variables in the decision transformer and how
    do you mean like return to go？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right， so optimality variables we can think in the more simplest context as
    legislative or binary。so one is if you。Solt the goal and zero as if you did not
    solve the goal。And what basically in that case， you could also think of your decision
    transformer as at test time and we encode the returns to go。We could set it to
    one， which will basically mean that conditioned on optimalities optimality here
    means。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Solving the goal as one。Generate me the sequence of actions such that this would
    be true。Of course。our learning is not perfect， so it's not guarantee we'll get
    that。but we have trained the transformer in a way to interpret the returns to
    go as some notion of optimality。So is it is it if I'm interpreting this correctly，
    it's roughly like saying。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: show me what an optimal sequence of transitions look like。Because you've learned
    the model has learned sort of both successful and unsuccessful transitions。Exactly
    exactly and as we shall seen some experiments， we can for the binary case。it's
    either optimal or non optimal， but rarely this can be a continuous variable which
    it is in our experiment so we can also see what happens in between experimentally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，哦。Okay， so let's jump into the experiments so there are a bunch of experiments
    and I've picked out a few which I think are interesting and give the key results
    in the paper but feel free to refer the paper for you and even more detailed analysis
    on some of the components of our module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this first we can look at how well does it do on offline RL。so there are
    benchmarks for the Atari suite of environments and the Open eye gym and we have
    another environment keyto door which is especially hard because it contains Pass
    Was and requires you to do credit assignment that I'll talk about later。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But across the board we see that thisilent transformer is competitive with the
    state of the art model free offline RL methods in this case。this was a version
    of Q learning designed for offline RL。And it can do excellent when especially
    when there is long term assignment where traditional methods based on T learning
    would fail。Yeah， so the takeaway here should not be that we should we are at the
    stage where we can just substitute the existing algorithms for the decision transformer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but this is a very strong evidence in favor that this paradigm which is building
    on transformers will permit us to better aerate and improve the models to hopefully
    surpass the existing algorithms uniformly。and there is some early evidence of
    that in harder environments which do require credit long term credit assignment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can I ask a question here about the baseline， specifically TD learning？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm curious to know because I know that a lot of TD learning agents are feed
    forward networks are these baselines do they have recurrence。Yeah， yeah， so I
    think the conservative dual learning baselines here did have recur。but I'm not
    very sure so I can check back on this offline and get back to you on this。O k。Will
    be okay。Thank you。Also another quick question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so just how exactly do you evaluate the decision transformer here in the experiment
    so because you need to supply the returns to go so do you use the optimal。Like
    policy to get what's optimal reward and that in。so so here we basically look at
    the offline data that that is useful for training。And we said whatever was the
    maximum return in the offline data， we set the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Desire target are going to go as slightly higher than that， so 1。1 broke coefficient
    used。I see so and the performance sorry I'm not really what we're seeing or else
    but how is the performance defined here it just like is how much reward you get
    actually from the Yes yes so you can specify target return to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but there's no guarantee that the actual actions that you take will achieve
    that return so yeah so you you measure the true environmental return based on
    yeah I see but then like just curious like so what so are these performance the
    percentage you get like for like how much I guess your you recover from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next few months yeah so these are not percentages。these are some we have
    normalizing the returns so that everything costs between the 200。Yeah， yeah。I
    see then just wonder if you have a like a rough idea about how much like reward
    actually is recovered by the student transformers like does they say like if you
    specify。I want to get like 50 rewards， does it get 49 or is this even better sometimes
    or。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's an excellent question and my next。So here we're going to answer precisely
    this question that will asked is like if you feed in the target return。it could
    be expert or it could also non be expert how well does the mall actually do in
    attaining it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So the x axis is what we specify as the target return we want。and the y axis
    is basically how much， how well do we actually get？For reference。we have this
    green line， which is the oracles， so which means。😊。Whatever you desire that this
    student transformer gives it to you so this would have been the ideal case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it's a diagonal。We also have， because this is offline RL we have in orange。what
    was the best project between data sets， so the offline data is not perfect。so
    we just plot what is the upper bound on the offline data performance。And here
    we find that for the majority of the environments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is a good fit between the target return we feed in and the actual performance
    of the model。And there are some other observations which I wanted to take from
    this slide is that。Because they can vary this notion of reward。We can in some
    sense do multitask R by reward condition return conditioning this is not the only
    way to do multitask parallel you can specify a task via natural language you can
    via goal state and so on forth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but this is one notion where the notion of a task could be how much reward you
    want。嗯。And another thing to notice is occasionally these smallest extrapolate
    this is not a trend we have been seeing consistently。but we do see some signs
    of it， So if you look at for example Sequest。😊，Here。the highest return tri cleanerer
    data sets was pretty low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if we specify a return higher than that。For our decision transformer。we
    do find that the model is able to achieve。So it is able to generate tragic trees
    with returns higher than it ever saw in the day。嗯。I do believe that future work
    in this space trying to improve this model should think about how can this trend
    be more consistent across environments because this would really achieve the goal
    of offine RL。which is given suboptimal behavior， how do you get optimal behavior
    out of it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But remains to be seen how well this trend can be made consistent across environments。Can
    I jump in with a question。Yes， so I think that last point is really interesting
    and it's cool that you guys occasionally see it。I'm curious to know what happens。So
    this is all condition you give as an input。what return you would like and it tries
    to select a sequence of actions that gives it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm curious to know what happens if you just give it ridiculous inputs like
    for example。you know here here the order of magnitude for the return is like 50
    to 100。What happens if you put in 10000。Good question and this is something we
    tried early on I don't want to say if we went up to 10000 but we try like really
    high returns which not even an expert could get and generally we see this leveling
    performance so you can see hints of it in half Che arm and you know pong as well
    or Walker to some extent that if you look at the very end things start saturating。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So if you exceed what is like certain threshold which often corresponds with
    the best tragic threshold。but not always beyond that everything is similar returns
    so it's not that it so at least one good thing is it does not degrade in performance
    so it would have been a little bit worrying if you specified a return of 10000
    and gives you return which is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Train0 or something really new。So it's good that it stabilizes。but it's not
    that it keeps increasing on and on， so there would be a point where the performance
    would get saturated。Okay， thank you。I was also curious like so usually for transfer
    models you need a lot of data。so do you know how well like like how much data
    do you need like how where does it scale the data the performance？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah， so here we use。The standard。UmData like the D4 RL benchmarks for Mexico。which
    I think have million u transitions in the order of millions。For。Atari。we used
    one person of the replay buffer， which is smaller than the one we used for the
    Mujoco benchmarks。and I actually have a result in the very next slide which shows
    dis transformer especially being useful when you have a little data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So yeah， so I guess one question to ask before you move on。In the last slide。what
    do you mean again by return conditioning for like the multitask part？Yeah。so if
    you think about the returns to go at test time。the one you feed have to feed in
    as the starting token。As one girl。Specifying what policy you want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 喂。How is that multit？So it's multitask in the sense that because you can get
    different policies by changing your target return to go。you're essentially getting
    different behaviors encoded so think about for instance a hopper and you specify
    a return to go that's really low。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you're basically saying， get me an agent which will just stick around its
    initial state。And not going into unchared territory。And if you give it really，
    really high。then you're asking it to do the traditional task， which is to hop
    and go as far as possible without falling but can you qualify those multitask
    because that basically just means that your return conditioning is a cue for it
    to memorize right which is usually like one of the pitfalls of multitask。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm not sure if it's a task identifier， that's what I'm trying to say。So
    I'm not sure if it's memorization because like I think the purpose of this。I mean。like
    having an offline data set that's fixed is basically saying that it's very。very
    specific to if you had the same start state and you took the same actions and
    you had the same target fair turns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that would qualify as memorization。But here at test time we allow all of these
    things to change and in fact they do change so your initial state would be different。your
    target return it could be very could be a different scalar than one you ever saw
    during training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It yeah and so so essentially the model has to learn to generate that behavior
    starting from a different initial state and maybe a different value of the target
    return than it saw during during during training if the dynamics are stochastic
    that also makes so that even if you memorize the actions you're not guaranteed
    to get the next the same next state。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so you would actually have a bad correlation with the performance of the dynamics
    are also stochastic。Also， I was very curious how much time does it take to train
    business transformer？In general。So it takes about a few hours， so I want to say
    like about。45 hours。Depending on what quality GPU use， but yeah thats that's a
    reasonable estimate y call it thanks。Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so actually while doing this experiment， this project。we thought of a baseline
    which we were surprised as not there in previously traditional on offine RL but
    makes very much sense and we thought we should also think about whether decision
    transformers are actually doing something very similar that baseline and the baseline
    is what we call as person behavioral cloning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So behavioral clo， what it does is basically it ignores the returns。And simply
    imitates the agent looking by just trying to map the actions given the current
    states。This is not a good idea with an offline inter set which will have project
    trees of both low returns and high returns。So traditional vehicle cloning， it's
    common to see that as a baseline in offline Ral methods and it is unless you have
    a very high quality data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: does it is not a good baseline for offline RL。However， there is a version that
    we call as Per BC。which actually makes quite a lot of sense and in this version。We
    filter out the top tra trees from our offline set。once stop the ones which have
    the highest rewards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know the rewards for each transition you calculate the returns of the tra
    trees and you take the tra trees with the highest returns and keep a certain percentage
    of them。which is going to be hyperparameter here。And once you keep those top fraction
    of your tragic trees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you then just ask your module to imitate them。Whi so imitation learning also
    uses especially when it's used in the form of behavioral planning。it uses supervised
    learning， essentially it's a supervised learning problem so you could actually
    also get supervised learning objective functions if you did this filtering step。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oh。So。And what we find actually that for the moderate and highal regimes。the
    recent transform is actually very comparable to Pu and VC so it's a very strong
    baseline which I think all the future work in offline Rs should include there's
    actually an eyeC submission from last week which has a much more detailed analysis
    on justice this baseline that introduced in this paper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And。What we do find is that for low data regimes the dis transformer does much
    better than person behavioral clo。so this is for the Atari benchmarks where like
    I previously mentioned we have a much smaller data set。As compared to the Mojoko
    environments， and here we find that for even after varying the different fraction
    of the percentage hyperparameter here。we are generally not able to get the strong
    performance status in transformer gets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So 10% DCc basically means that we filter out and keep the top 10% of the trajectories
    if you go even lower then the start data set becomes fairly small so the baseline
    become meaningless。But for even the reasonable ranges， we'd never find the performance
    matching that of the transformers for these Atari benchmarks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 呃的铁 I may。So I notice in table three， for example， which is not this table with
    one just before in the paper。there's a report on the CQL performance， which to
    me also feels you know intuitively pretty similar to the percent BC in the sense
    of like you pick trajectories you know performing well and you try and stay roughly
    within sort of the same kind of policy distribution。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It state space distribution。I was curious on this one。do you have a sense of
    what the CQL performance was relative to say the percent BC performance here？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's a great question， question is that even for CQL you rely on this notion
    of pessimism where you want to pick trajectories where you're more confident in
    and try to make sure policy remains in that region。so I don't have the numbers
    with CQL on this table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but if you look at the detailed results for Atring。Then I think should they
    should have the SQL for sure because that's the numbers we are reporting here
    so I can tell you what the sQL performance is actually pretty good and it's very
    competitive。When the decision transformer for aary？So this TD learning baseline
    here is SeQ。So financially by extension， I would imagine it doing better than
    person B。Yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And apologize apologize if this was mentioned， I just missed it。but if you have
    the sense that this is basically like a failure of CQL to be able to extrapolate
    well or sort of stitch together different parts of trajectories。Whereas a decision
    transformer can sort of make that extrapolation between you have like the first
    half of one trajectory is really good the second half of one trajectory is really
    good so you can actually piece those together a decision transformer where you
    can't necessarily do that with CQL because the path connecting those may not necessarily
    be well covered by the behavior policy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah， yeah， so and this actually goes to one of the intuitions which I did not
    emphasize too much。but we have a discussion on the paper where essentially why
    do we expect a transformer or any model for that matter to look at offline data
    that's suboptimal and get something a policy which generates optimal loadouts？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The intuition is that as Scott was mentioning， you could perhaps。Stitch together。Good
    behaviors from suboptimal trajectories and that stitching could perhaps lead to
    a behavior that was better than anything you saw in individual tra trees in your
    data set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's something we find earlier evidence of small skill experiment for graphs。and
    that's really our hope also that something that will transformers very good at
    because it can attend to very long sequences so it could identify those segments
    of behavior。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which when stitch together would give you optimal optimal behavior。So。And it's
    very much possible that is something unique to this in transformers and something
    like CQL would not be able to do person BCC because it's filtering out the data
    is automatically being limited and not being able to do that because those segments
    of good behavior could be in trajectories which overall do not have a high return。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but so if you filter them out， you are losing all of that information。Okay。so
    I said there is hyperparameter the context in K and like with most of perception。one
    of the big advantages of transformers opposed to other sequence models like LSTMs
    is that they can process really large sequences。And here at a first glance， it
    might seem that being Markcoan would have been helpful for RL。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which also was a question that was raised earlier。so we did this experiment
    where we did compare performance with context and K equals1 and here we had context
    and between 30 for the environments in 50 for pong and we find that increasing
    the context length is very。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: very important to get good performance。Okay。Now呃。So so far I've showed you how
    this in transformformer。which is very simple， there was no slide I had which was
    going into the details of dynamic programming。which is the crux of most R， this
    was just pure supervised learning in an autoregressive framework that was getting
    us as good performance。嗯。What about cases where this approach actually starts
    outperforming some of the traditional methods are so to probe a little bit further
    we start looking at sparse reward environments and basically we just took our
    existing mojoku environments and then instead of giving it the information for
    reward for every transition we fed it the cumulative reward at the end of the
    trajectory so every transition will have a zero reward except the very end where
    you get the entire reward at once it's a very sparse reward perform scenario for
    that reason。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here we find that。哦。Compared to the original denses results， the delayed
    results for Dt。they will deteriorate a little bit， which is expected because now
    you are withholding some of the more fine grain information at every time step。but
    the drop is。Not too significant compared to the original E performance here。whereas
    for something like CQL there is a drastic drop in performance so CQL suffers quite
    a lot in sparse reward scenarios。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the distant transformer does more。And just for completeness if you also
    have performance of behavioral training and person behavioral clo。which because
    they don't look at reward information。except maybe person BC looks at only for
    preprocessing the data set。these are agnostic to whether the environments as spa
    wordss or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Would you expect this to be different if you were doing online R。嗯。What's the
    intuition for it being different April I would say no。but maybe I'm missing out
    on a key piece of intuition behind that question。嗯。I think that because you're
    training like offline， right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like your're the next input will always be the correct action in that sense。So
    you don't just like deviate and like go off the rails technically because you
    just don't know。So I could see like how online would have like a really hard。Like
    cold start basically because it just doesn't know and it's just happeningping
    in the dark until it like maybe eventually hits the jackpot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right， right I think I agree that so that's a good piece of intuition out there
    that yeah。I think here because offline R is really。Getting rid of the trial and
    error aspect of it and firstpa reward environment that would be harder so。The
    drop in DT performance should be more prominent there。I'm not sure how it would
    compare with the drop performance for other algorithms but it does seem like an
    interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Set up to test DTN。Well and I did to maybe i'm wrong here。but my understanding
    with the decision transformer as well is this is this critical piece that in the
    training you use the rewards to go right so is it is it not the sense that essentially
    like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: は。For each trajectory from the initial state based on the training regime。The
    model has access to whether or not the final result was a success or failure，
    right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that's sort of that's sort of the unique aspect of the training regime for
    decision transformers whereas in CQL。My understanding is that it's based on sort
    of a per transition。Training regime and so each transition is decoupled somewhat
    to what what the final reward was。is that correct？Yes， although like one difficulty
    which at a first glance you kind of imagined the discipline transform we're having
    is that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That initial token will not change throughout the trajectory。Yeah because it's
    this past reward scenario， so except the very last token where it will drop down
    to zero all of a sudden the token remains the same throughout。But maybe that that
    but I think you're right that maybe just even at this start。Peding it in a manner
    which looks at the future rewards that you need to get to is perhaps one part
    of the reason why the drop in performance is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not noticeable。Yeah， I mean， I guess one sort of abl experiment here would be
    if you change the training regime so that only the last trajectory had the award。but
    I'm trying to think about whether or not that would just be compensated for by
    sort of the attention mechanism anyway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And vice versa right， if you embedded that reward information into the CQL training
    procedure as well。I'd be curious to see what would happen there。Yeah， a good experiments。Okay，
    so related to this。theres another environment we tested I gave you a brief preview
    of the results in one of the earlier slides。so this is called the keycudo environment。😊，And
    it has three phases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so in the first phase you the agent is placed in a room with the key。A good
    agent will pick up the key and then they do it replaced in an empty room。And in
    phase three。it will be placed in a room at the door where it will actually use
    the key that it collected in phase one if it did to open the door。😊，So essentially
    the agent is going to receive a binding reward corresponding to whether it reached
    and opened the door in phase three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Conditioned on the fact that it。Did pick up the key in phase one。So there is
    this national notion of that you want to assign credit to something that happened
    to an event that happened really in the past。so it's very challenging。And sensible
    scenario if you wanted to estimate models for how well they are at long term credit
    assignment。And here we find that so we tested it for different amounts of project
    trees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so here the number of project trees basically see how often would you actually
    see this kind。Of behavior and the listen transformer is and person behavioral
    to both of these actually baseline。Do do much better than other models which struggle
    at this。does。哦。There's a related experiment there which is also of interest。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so generally a lot of oral algorithms have this notion of an actor and a critic。actor
    is basically someone that takes actions condition on the states to think of a
    policy。a critic is basically evaluating how good these actions are in terms of
    achieving a long term。in terms of the cummulative sum of rewards in the long term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a good environment because we can see how how well the distant transformer
    would do if it was trained as a critic so here what we did is。Instead of having
    the actions as the output target， what if you substituted that with the rewards？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's very much possible， we can again use the same causal transformer machinery
    to only look at transitions in the previous time step and try to play the reward。And
    here we see this interesting pattern where in the three phases that we had in
    that key to door environment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We do see the reward probability changing very much in how we expect so basically
    the three scenarios so the agent。the first scenario let's look at blue。In which
    the agent does not pick up the key in pays fund。So the reward probability， they
    all start around the same。but as it becomes apparent that the agent is not going
    to pick up the key。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the reward starts going down。And then it stays very much close to zero throughout
    the episode because there is no way you will have the key to open the door in
    the future phases。If you pick up the key。There are two possibilities。哦。Which remain
    which are essentially the same in phase two where you are in an empty room。Which
    is just a distractor to make the episode really long。But at the very end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the two possibilities are one that you take the key and you actually reach the
    door。which is the one we see in orange and brown here where you see that the reward
    probability goes up。😊，And is is this other possibility that you actually pick
    up the key but do not reach the door in which case。again， it starts seeing that
    the reward probability that's predicted starts going down？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the takeaway from this experiment is that mission transformers are not just
    great actors。which is what we've been seeing so far in the results from the optimized
    policy。but they are also very impressive critics in doing this long-tered and
    assignment where the reward is also very sparse。So just to be correct， are you
    predicting the rewards to go at each time stuff or is it is this like the the
    like the reward at each time stuff？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you predicting。So this was the rewards to go and I can also check my impression
    was in this particular the experiment it didn't really make a difference。whether
    we were predicting rewards to go or the actual rewards。But I think Lu returns
    to go further this one。Also most curious so how do you get the probability distribution
    on the rewards。is it just like you just evaluate a lot of different episodes and
    just part the rewards or are you explicitly predicting some sort of distribution？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oh， so this is a binary reward so you can have a probabilistic outcome。哪的。have
    a question。yeah。So generally， we will call like some， something predicts the state
    value or state actual value as critic。But in this case， you， you ask decision
    transformer to only predict the reward。So why should you still call it a critic。So
    I think the analogy here gets a bit clear with returns to go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like if you think what returns to go， it's really capturing that essence that
    you want to see the future rewards so I mean it's just going to predict the return
    to go instead of single step reward。right？Yeahや， yeah。Okay， so， so if you're gonna

    returns to go if it pick up the K。But in in the plot you， you know， in the key
    room， the agents pick up K and the agent that。Didn't pick tea has the same kind
    level of returns to go。 So that's quite countertuitive to me。I think this is reflecting
    on a good property， which is that your distribution。Like if you interpret。

    three outcomes are really possible and phase one also I'm talking about the very
    big meaning basically。slowly you will learn about it， but essentially in phase
    one。if you see the returns to go as one or zero for all three possibilities are
    equally likely。And all three possibilities， so if we try to evaluate the predicted。

    because previous that salter green line is the agent which doesn't pick up the。but
    it turns out a blue line is agent which doesn't pick up。Okay， so yeah， it's my

    task being specified by natural language instruction and because these models
    can very well play with these kinds of inputs。the hope is that they would be easy

    assignment。So there's a lot of future work， this is definitely not the end。this
    is a first work in rethinking how do we build our agents that can scale and generalize。嗯。A
    few things that I picked out， which I feel would be very exciting to extend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is multimodality， so really one of our big motivations with going
    after these kinds of models is that we can combine different kinds of inputs both
    online and offline。To really build decision making agents which work like humans。we
    process so many inputs around us in different modalities and we act on them so
    we do take decisions and we want the same to happen in artificial agents and maybe
    decision transformers is one important step in that route。Multiitaask so I should
    or I described very limited form of multitasking here。

- en: which was based on the desired returns to go。But it could be more richer in
    terms of。Specifying a command to be a robot or a desired goal state， which could
    be， for example， even visual。So trying to better explore the different multitask
    capabilities of this model would also be an interesting extension。Finally， multi
    agent。As human beings we never act in isolation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we are always acting within an environment that involves many， many more agents。things
    become partially observable in those scenarios。which plays to the strengths of
    distant transformformers being non-marovviian by design。so I think there is great
    possibilities of exploring even multi agentent scenarios where the fact the transformers
    can process very large sequences compared to existing algorithms could again help
    build better models of other agents in your environment and act。

    website。the paper and the code are all public。And I'm happy to take any more questions。UOkay，
    so I said。thanks for the good talk。really appreciate it。Everyone had a good time
    here。诶。So I think we are like near the class limit so usually I have like a round
    of record five questions for the speaker that just like the students usually know。

    we stop the recording， so if anyone wants to like leave earlier at this time。just
    feel free to ask your questions。Otherwise， I would just like continue on。So what
    do you think is like the future of like transformers in LL do you think they will
    take over like they've already taken over like language and vision。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do you think for like model based and like model field learning。you think like
    youll see a lot more like transformers pop up in LL literature。Yes。I think we'll
    see a flurry of work， if not already。we have there's so many works using transformers
    at this year's eyeC conference。Having said that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I feel that an important piece of the puzzle that needs to be solved is explorationiration。It's
    non trivial， and it will。my guess is that you will have to forego some of the
    advantages that I talked about for transformers in terms of loss functions to
    actually enable explorationir。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it remains to be seen whether those modified dose functions。For exploration
    actually hurt performance significantly。but as long as we cannot cross that bottleneck，
    I think it is， I'm not。I do not want to commit that this is indeed the future
    of our。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go it also your question Sure I'm not sure understood that point。so you're saying
    that in order to apply transformers in RL to do exploration there have to be particular
    loss functions and and they're tricky for some reason。Could you explain more like
    what are the modified loss functions and why do they seem tricky？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So a sense in exploration。You have to do the opposite of exploitation， which
    is not a with you。And there is right now no nothing inbuilt in the transformer
    right now。which encourages that sort of random behavior。Where you seek out。Unfaili
    unfamiliar parts of in state space。That is something which is inbuil into traditional
    algorithms so usually has some sort of entropy bonus to encourage explorationir
    and those are the sort of modifications which one will also need to think about
    if one were to use this transforms for online RL So what happens if somebody I
    mean just naively suppose I have this exact same setup and the way that I sample
    the action is I sample epsilon greedily or I create a boltzman distribution and
    I sample from that I mean what happens it seems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what OrL does so does what happens。So ArL does a little bit more than
    that。it indeed does those kinds of things where it would change the distribution，
    for example。that your postal distribution sample from it。But it's also， there
    are these。as I said the devil lies in the detail， it's also about how it controls
    that explorationir component with the exploitation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，And it remains to be seen whether that is compatible with distant transformers。I
    don't want to jump the gun， but I would say it it's I mean。Preliminary evidence
    suggests that it's not directly transferable exact same setup to the online case
    that's what we have found。there has to be some adjustments to be made to make
    but we are still figuring it out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the reason why I ask is as you said the devil's in the details and so someone
    naively like me might just come along and try doing what's an RL。I want to hear
    more about this， so you're saying that what works in RL may not work for decision
    transformers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Can you tell us why， like what pathologies emerge？What are those devils？Hiding
    in the details。also remind you like the sorry we are like also over time so definitely
    okay turn feel free to like follow up but like to me that's really exciting and
    I'm sure that it's tricky。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yeah I will just ask like two more questions and like you finish sh those so
    one is like Eric did you think like something like this transformer is a way to
    solve a k center problem in oil instead of using some sort of like discon factoror。😊，This
    isSo that can you repeat the question sorry Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think usually in parallel we have to allow on some sort of disor to encode
    the rewards to go that but it in transformableer transformer is able to do this
    credit assignment without that。So do you think like something like this book is
    like the way you should do it like we should。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like instead of having some discount， try to directly predict the rewards。So
    I would go on to say that I feel that discount factor is an important consideration
    in general and it's not incompatible with discipline transformers。So basically
    what would change and I think the code actually gives that functionality where。The
    returns to Google would be computed as the discounted sum of rewards。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so it is very much compatible， so there's scenarios where our context length
    is still is not enough to actually capture the long term behavior we really need
    for credit assignment。maybe traditional tricks that are used could be brought
    in back to solve those kinds of problems。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Got it。Yeah， also thought like when I was reading the distance transform work
    that the interesting thing is。Then you don't have a fixed gamma like a gamma is
    like usually a hypopenimeter like。You don't have a fixed gamma so do you think
    like can you also like learn this thing and could this also be like。can you have
    a different gamma for each gesture or something， possibly？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That would be interesting actually， I had not thought of that。but maybe learning
    to predict the discount factor could be another extension of this work。😊，Also。do
    you think like this like a decision transformer work is like like is it compatible
    with Q learning so if you have something like EQL stuff like that。can you also
    implement those sort of loss functions？😊，On top of a decision transformer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I think maybe I could imagine ways in which you could encode pessimism in
    here as well。which is key to how CQL works， and actually most of oftenal algorithms
    work。including the model based ones。Our focus here deliberately was to go out
    is simplicity because we feel that part of the reason why oural literature has
    been so scattered as well if you think about different sub problems that everyone
    tries to solve has been because everyone's tried to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，Pick up on IDOs which are very well suited for that narrow problem like for
    example。you have whether you're doing offline or you're doing online or you're
    doing imitation。you're doing multitals and all these different variants。And so
    by design， we did not we were very。we did not want to incorporate exactly the
    components that exist in the current algorithms because then it just where it
    starts looking more like。

    about RS sequence modeling。Very generally。cor it， yeah just。So do you think like
    we can use some sort of like like3 learning objectives instead of supervised learning？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 诶。It's possible and maybe like I'm saying that for certain like for online RL，
    it might be necessary。😊，Of， we were happy to see it was not necessary。But it remains
    to be seen more generally for a transformer model or any other model for that
    matter。encompassing R more broadly whether that becomes a necessity。哦也。Well， thanks
