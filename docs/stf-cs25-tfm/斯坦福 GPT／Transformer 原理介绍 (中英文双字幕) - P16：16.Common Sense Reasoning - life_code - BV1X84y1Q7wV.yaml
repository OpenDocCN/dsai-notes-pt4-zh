- en: Okay， so yeah， I'm super excited to be here and share our recent research about
    neurosymbolic common sense reasoning。So part of the goal of this talk will be
    to address some of the frequently asked questions these days that NLP or common
    sense or whatever it looks like almost solved by ChegPT and I have an existential
    crisis so people do ask me this from time to time so perhaps it's a case of hasty
    generalization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially if we do look at some of the examples so the trophy doesn't fit in
    the brown suitcase because it's too big。what's too big so this is classical Wininograd
    schema challenge problem and here ChegPT answers it correctly that trophy is too
    big so impressive but what if you change the question a little bit then he says
    the trophy itself is too small to fit into the suitcase so it's not very reliable
    at the moment。

    bugar appears to be better in many of the cases。although of course some of the
    more careful studies do reveal that smaller models can be better with the better
    data or better reinforcement to learning with the human feedback and whatnot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it's likely that there are still other ways to improve the transformer performances
    by building smaller models in a more clever way。so one way to draw the insight
    is from these classic book known as the art of a war。which of course it says nothing
    about deep neural networks or transformers。but the wisdom here is that no your
    enemyusier battles and innovate your weapons。

    tasks and leader boards and then innovating your algorithms and data。So in this
    talk I'm going to showcase three such studies and let's dive right in with myic
    prompting。by the way， so the recording theme in this talk will be that smaller
    models can be better and the knowledge is power。so。

- en: Let's start with this observation that language models are sometimes amazing。so
    if you ask G3。if you travel west to far enough from the west coast。you will reach
    to the east coast or not so it says the world is around which is correct so you
    will reach the east coast eventually therefore the answer is true so this looks
    impressive。except to when it's not impressive， so if you ask other questions like
    a butterflies fly with the three wings or not it says it has the four wings。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: therefore the statement is a false， but if you read the back what it just said
    as true false questions then it negates what it just said so it can be inconsistent
    with its own statement and then there are many other such inconsistency problems
    so it's not clear what language models do or do not know it's almost like language
    models are some sort of lemons。

- en: Well， it might be cherries if you only pick cherries。but it doesn't make strange
    mistakes so the question is how do we make better lemonade from GPT3 so one approach
    might be to get philosophical and use of Socratess myurtic method that was originally
    developed for addressing humans of law reasoning because it actually turns out
    even humans are not all that logically consistent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let alone GPT3。So the way it works is this we're going to build the myic inference
    tree and let's use the previous example as a running example。So what we do is
    we ask the following question， providing the answer being true and then let attach
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/f6064823a2db16085967ebdd0dffc7e6_11.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So that we prompted GT3 to continue on this。Sentence， which means it will now
    have to explain。provide the explanation why the answer is true。In this case， the
    explanation is good。So we it's the E of T explanation of the answer being T。We
    ask the same question。switch not true with the false。 and then see what。BS GP3
    might come up with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so here is just trying to go with the false as an answer。but it just doesn't
    have a very good answer just as you cannot reach。So now we call this as the E
    of F。So it's an explanation of F answer being F。Now let's see how robust or consistent
    GT3 is with respect to its own explanations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we read the back E of T and then let GPT3 to decide whether it's going to
    agree or disagree with a label true or false so in this case the last one is negated
    version of E over a t so we insert negation not here and in this case it's good
    that it's a Philipine answer when the statement is negated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so this is a case when GPT3 is logically integral to E of T。For E ofva Fodo。which
    was basically a Bogus explanation for the wrong answer。it's not able to flip its
    own labeling， which means a GPT3 is not logically integral。so that's good， GT3
    does know something strange about its own explanation given previously。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we can keep doing this recursively to let to make G3 to explain its own
    explanation of explanation recursively。so we build this myoric tree or graph。![](img/f6064823a2db16085967ebdd0dffc7e6_13.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For some time and then only keep branches that are logical integral throwing
    out the non integral part for now。but even after chopping the branches where there's
    logical inconsistencies。GPT3 being GPT3 the tree will still have some inconsistent
    explanations so in order to improve the logical consististency now what we do。Is
    we are going to look at pairwise consistency among any of the nodes so we compute
    sorry stepping back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we are going to first compute the nodewise confidenced。So we call that as a
    belief and it's defined by this particular equation that basically it looks at
    different conditional probabilities and then compute its ratio to see how confident
    it is for any particular node。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we then also look at the edge or pairwise consistency by using off the shelf
    natural language inference models output。whether a pair is contradiction or not，
    so we then create this pairwise weights。Now。once you have all of this， then。We
    can formulate a constrained optimization problem where the inference objective
    is to assign some label。either true or false on each of the nodes such that it's
    going to maximize the weight assigned to all of these node and edges。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So sometimes the labeling will have to flip the original label that Mom might
    have a prefer to give because that way you can enhance the graph level consistency
    so you can solve this with any mix set。so set means satisfiability。And this is
    a classical AI search algorithm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we used this particular solver， but you can use many others and。So here
    the final output is that the original answer to the original question should be
    true。and then it also gives you nodewise per node label assignment as well。So
    what does this mean in the end in terms of empirical result， so when tested on
    common sense QA 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 0。The canonical prompting， so green used on top of G3。so it's basically a fus
    prompting on G3 will give you a bit better than chance performances。so this is
    true false QA data set so your chance level is 50 and GP3 is barely better than
    chance。but recently there have been some ideas such as chain of thoughts or self-consistency
    there can improve the vanilla prompting method considerably so if you use such
    variations then you get performance gain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， the purple is the。A different variant of it， but together they're all doing
    worse than myic prompting。which in fact does better than supervise the model trained
    on T5。Usually supervised model trend on T5 is a hard to beat using GT3 few shot。but
    basically this is inference time on the algorithm practically unsupervised and
    it does well on that and similarly we see large boost when tested on other common
    sense benchmarks such as C or come to sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so what this tells us is that although。The emergent capabilities of large transformers
    are phenomenal。They can be not very robust for some of these common sense challenges。and
    it's in large part due to the logical inconsistencies。which can be dramatically
    enhanced when you do this sort of symbolic reasoning on top。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this work is a work that tries to convert general language models on top
    of transformers to causal common sense models。also transformers。![](img/f6064823a2db16085967ebdd0dffc7e6_21.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the reason why we might want to worry about common sense models is because
    despite。Han level or even superhuman level performances on a variety of leader
    board。the state of the art models are brittle when given adversarial or out of
    domain examples。so transformers can make seemingly strange mistakes。And so solving。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's almost like solving only a data set without really solving the underlying
    task and this phenomenon sometimes is described as a systematic generalization
    problem and why does this happen is that unlike humans who truly learn about how
    the world works conceptually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: transformers learn，Sort of a surface patterns in language or images that are
    powerful for many downstream use cases。but still not really robust understanding
    of the concepts and how the world works so in order to bridge this gap。we can
    really think about this challenge of learning。acquiring common sense capabilities
    for machines。 So the operational definition of a common sense in this talk will
    be that it's the basic level of practical knowledge and reasoning concerning everyday
    situations and events that are commonly shared among the most people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is really important the last part that's commonly shared among the most
    people but it's not the case that is shared by everybody in the universe。Because
    the additional context it can always change what is commonsensical for any given
    culture or situation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so for example， in general， you and I probably agree that it's okay to keep
    the closed door open but it's not okay to keep the fridgegi door open because
    the food inside might go bad so these are general rules of the thumbs that we
    might or by the by。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you know of course， if you go to your friend's house。you might behave a
    little bit and you know keep their closed doors open sorry closed and then as
    far as a fridgegi door if you're in a store and it's not really hooked up to the
    wall。then it doesn't matter when whether the fridge door is open or not because
    there's no food inside and you know you can come up with in many situation in
    which these basic rules of the thumbs will have exceptions so。That is the key
    challenge of common sense because it's not universal knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it's sort of like shared across a large population of people。Okay， so it's
    essential。such common sense is essential for humans to live and interact with
    each other in a reasonable and safe way。and so as AI becomes increasingly more
    important aspect of human lives。and with ChaGPT more likely so， it's good if AI
    can understand human needs and actions and values better。

- en: So the premise of this talk is that language models are not equivalent to knowledge
    models。even though language models today do acquire a great deal of knowledge
    but they're not equivalent。so we developed symbolic common sense knowledge graph
    known as atomic a few years ago。four years ago now， as well as neural common sense
    model built on top of or trained using atomic as the source of training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fine tuning of the shelf language models。until two years ago。this atomic was
    fully crowd sourced by humans。Which in this talk I'm going to lift。but at first
    the almost that these all has to be human criceors so you can consider almost
    atomic as human demonstration in the current version of CheGPT。you can consider
    this as human demonstrations of common sense inferences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we had this comet atomic 2020， which is enhanced the version of atomic end
    thecomt， again。atomic portionion was fully crowdtosourced by humans in 2021。So
    let me give you a bit of。![](img/f6064823a2db16085967ebdd0dffc7e6_25.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A sample of what atomic 2020 looks like。So imagine a situation where x gets
    x is car repaired or you get your car repaired。So。Immediately you can imagine
    what's likely be true or relevant for the situation that as a result you might
    want to call Uber or Ly for right as a result you need to pay the bill beforehand
    you need a mechanic and money to repair your cars so these are basically preconditions
    and post conditionsditions of that event so some of these atomic knowledge graph
    is about social interaction knowledge about event and then other parts of the
    atomic is physical andcentric knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so money is typically used for paying repairs but if you really want it。you
    can fold the data into origami I've never done it。but these are examples of stereotypical
    use cases as well as nonsterereotypical but affordable actions that you can apply
    to objects so it requires na physics understanding about the affordances of a
    physical object。た？And then we can also reason about counterfactual condition in
    which the center event cannot happen so can be hindered by that so if you total
    your car completely then it's impossible to get your cars repaired and then there
    are like events that typically happens before and after so some of these knowledge
    is eventcentric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we crowdsourced a fair amount over the course of， I don't know， maybe two
    years or so。Up to 1。3 million if than rules or E than knowledge。Over 23 different
    a types or relation types。嗯。So it was a fully crowded sourced and so the knowledge
    graph is useful for training transformers。And here， let's see the comparison between
    Comt that was built on Bart compared to GT3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is so large it doesn't even fit into the slide。It was more than 400 times
    larger than partt。So with that in mind if you look at this accuracy judged by
    humans after making the common sense model making some common sense inferences。so
    the task is that given a node which describes a situation or event and then given
    an edge type which sort of narrows down the common sense relation or inference
    type。you're now going to generate some inference， so it's a generative task and
    then we ask humans whether the common sense inference seems reasonable or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so 100% is the desired level，Comade is substantially better than GPT3。which
    is really impressively better than GPT2， it's not Apple to Apple because GPT2
    is a zero shot GPT3 is a few shot。but still it's interesting the large jump that
    scale alone brought to GPT3。So but still GPT3 is too large to be useful for actual
    system building for most engineers and scientists in the world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it's nice to have a smaller model that does it do even better。![](img/f6064823a2db16085967ebdd0dffc7e6_27.png)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    creative research using it。so persona aware conversations or figurative language
    understanding。sStorytelling and fantasy gaming and interactive learning enhancement
    in all of these works。people came up with some useful use cases using either Kot
    or atomic or both as some kind of common sense backbone for their downstream use
    cases。

- en: But the applications are still limited by the coverage and quality of this common
    sense model so we wanted to make it better。but we were hitting a bit of a limit
    with human crowd sosourcing。So now in this paper。symbolic knowledge distillation
    we're going to do AI generated knowledge graph by introducing this notion symbolic
    knowledge distillation。so we want to take this GP3， which is very impressive about
    too large。

- en: So make it smaller， but better than G 3。So G3 was about 73% of good and it's。Good。but
    not good enough for empirical use cases。Now， is that even possible though。because
    when you normally do knowledge distillation， you get smaller and worse models。not
    better models？So the reason why this could work is because。嗯。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason why this could work is because the symbolic knowledge dist has a
    disonel that's convoluted and it has a critical insight that really helps the
    student to model to be smaller but better。so slightly more formally knowledge
    distillation due to hintnetl 2015 is a method to distill teacher model down to
    student to model by optimizing this crossenttropy between the teacher' probability
    distribution over the label spaceway。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Output y， and then the student distribution over the same output y。In the original
    work。the output space was just classification。Knowledge this delevation was done
    for classification task。in which case it's a simple enumeration that leads to
    the correct assumption。but in our case y can be a sentence which is intractable
    because there can be exponentially many such output so what people do well you
    know no problem we always just sample and call it a day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we are going to sample and so that we just compute the expectation through
    samples。And the byproduct of that samples will be a symbolic knowledge graph。And
    that's because the strings coming out of this sampling can be connected together
    into graph structure if we want it。So。In terms of the quality of the generated
    knowledge。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so let's compare human written knowledge versus GT3 authored knowledge。Here
    the y axis shows the quantity in millions， so atomic 2020。the human return knowledge
    is less than a million in this particular case。in terms of the number of knowledge
    because we only in this study。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we only look at a subset of atomic 2020 relation types that corresponds to causal
    common sense knowledge common sense causal common sense reasoning so。It's less
    than a million for that subset and then if we look at G3's generation we can generate
    a lot so we can generate almost 7 million of them but here black Perian is noisy
    Perian and green Per is a good Persian and you see because GP3 is only about 70%
    to good like 30% or all garbage so it's a larger scale lower accuracy at this
    point compared to human return resource so now what we do is we train this critic
    model and we use a robota for simplicity and this is a supervised model on a moderate
    size labeled the data about 10。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 000 or so and it's a binary classification task where whether the machine generated
    the knowledge looks correct or not。And this robota is not a very good model because
    if so if it's a perfect。we would have a solved the common sense problem altogether。So
    the critic tries to throw out that stuff。 And we can use it the critic very aggressively
    with a high threshold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So whenever something is slightly suspicioususpicious， just throw that out。But
    if we use it aggressively。 So we throw out most of the black。that's good。together
    with a lot of green stuff。but still the remainder is much larger than what humans
    ever beaten。And yet we can actually retain higher accuracy than human authored
    resources So here the teacher is a basically called a combination between GPT3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is in some sense loose teacher and then combined with the critic Roberta
    which serves as critic teacher Okay so that's the generated knowledge now how
    helpful are they for the purpose of training downstream neural common sense models。So
    recall that the GT3 without doing anything else is a loose teacher whose common
    sense inference is only about 73% good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you see here it's accuracy of its output and then it turns out if we use
    loose teacher as a teacher directly to teach a student model。then the performance
    already goes up on its own so this is interesting that usually this is not the
    case with the knowledge distillation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but when we focus on common sense knowledge distillation。student just on its
    own becomes better so unlike typical knowledge distillation where we start with
    language model and we end with language model。students and teacher of the same
    type here the original teacher was actually language model。not common sense model，
    and then we want the student model to be more of the common sense model so there's
    a switch of the type。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In teacher and student， and so when that's the case， whether this is generally
    true， we don't know。but this is what we found empirically。嗯。Ohh， should I pay
    attention to the questions or not？yeah。feel free to any relevant questions hang
    on， let me quickly check。呃。Yeah。sample oh sample is generated output， which happens
    to be usually a sentence or phrase。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's what we what I meant by sample， sorry that I didn't see that earlier
    and then the last question。Having the model generate text to one symbol at a time，
    starting from the target label sentence， yes。it's because transformer can only
    generate one word one token at a time， that's what we do。As well here。 Thank you
    for the clarification questions。 All right， so back to here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our earlier study， commma 2020， if we train GT to or bart using。Human author
    graph knowledge graph atomic then the performance was a bit better than 80% Now
    finally when we use basically a combination of GPT3 and Roberta together。we found
    that the downstream performance of the neural causal reasoning is reaching close
    to 90% for the first time so the takeaway here is that critical teacher resulting
    better student compared to loose teacher。It's not the quantity of knowledge because
    loose teacher basically has more data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you one might wonder whether more data is always better for the purpose of common
    sense models。but that's another case loose teacher can generate more data。but
    the resulting student to model is not as good as the case when the critical teacher
    which has less data because you throw out most of your generation。It's a smaller
    data， but it leads to better model， so that's sort of takeaway messages here。

- en: 嗯。So to summarize we were very surprised by this outcome that at least with
    respect to a subset of the original atomic 2020。it's a subset corresponding to
    causal common sense reasoning。we found it to our big surprise that machine author
    the knowledge graph can be for the first time better than human author the knowledge
    graph in all criteria。scale accuracy and diversity。We also measure the diversity
    in many different ways。 here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just show you unique uniogram counts， but we in the paper， we report other
    measures as well。So it's not the case that。GPT3 is being reetative。it's actually
    being more creative in some sense than human crowd workers while being able to
    enhance other aspects as well。By the way， these enhancements are sort of like
    you kind of have to balance out depending on what you prioritize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you cannot actually get all of this simultaneously。so I'm just showing the best
    case and scenario here。All right so that's the symbolic knowledge dissillation
    part we actually have a followup work on this on several different application
    scenarios even including summarization where we distill summarization capabilities
    from GT3 and demonstrate that GPT2 can work as well as GPT3 or even better for
    summarization task and then we also have other work where we can distill from
    smaller models but I don't have the content in this talk so but just wanted to
    mention that this particular technique despite its a simplicity we found that
    empirically works really really well across several different downstream use cases。

    work I went through this super fast。

    this is because we found the chatbots。the publicly available ones。Tend to endorse，
    tend to be too positive to the point that they're going to endorse problematic
    situations like user says Holocaust never happened。

    a big fan of a hitler then the chapd might say yeah， yeah， yeah。you know the user
    myself I'm so depressed I'm going to kill myself and then the chapel says go ahead
    a great idea。So being positive is not。Being harmless， being positive to a problematic
    content can be very toxic and very harmful。

- en: So the Delphi you know development like Delphi， even though Delphi is so far
    from being perfect and it's also biased。it has a Western bias。Could really help
    with the downstream models。Yeah。so continuing on that question， there has been
    many concerns about using G like models with the search because misinformation。wu，
    that's anotherken of worms。Others to say we just need more R RLHF plus knowledge
    graphs。So yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: misinformation is， yeah， something else that seems。We are really lagging behind
    because we don't have a very powerful fact checking models yet。So that's a different
    story。But even that aside， just in terms of norms and ethics that。arere safe and
    fair for people to use， I think AdLHF direction is great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they usually also need a human demonstration， not just the human feedback。And
    again。the problem is that tech companies own them。And nobody issing anything。And
    that makes it really difficult to make meaningful progress as a community together。so
    I do think that data is really important， the off shelf models cannot learn modelss
    and ethics on their own。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it has to be somehow taught more directly。We really just need to do more research
    in this space period is how I view it。Yeah that makes sense。we also have some
    like questions on status so I can ask them for you Yeah folks so one question
    is。what's the complexity of。May you take prompting， how many times does the LM
    need to bequeri？Yeah。so honestly， it's a bit slow。In fact， this Addelphi hybrid
    is also slow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you try to do this like graph reasoning， Oh， this， maybe I'm not going to
    do that。but the graph reasoning is slow because you have to call。You know， so
    many times over and over。And some of these can be batched， some of these cannot
    be batched， especially if it's a recursive。but I would say chain of a thought
    is also a bit slower。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the max set solver in itself is pretty fast because this is such an easy graph。so
    there's a bit of a delay but its so it's a bit slower but maybe not too bad is
    what I should have said。没。Cool， and the question is。Let's see， how does connector
    compare to G3 if GPT3 is fine tune and common sense data specifically adding some
    sort of like instruction pan。Yeah， so then the larger wins period， the larger
    is going to be the better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially if you're going to just fine tune G3 it's a game over。So for that
    reason。you know some folks might think that the larger is always a better。therefore
    don't work on smaller model， but I think there are two reasons as to why small
    models are interesting to look at as well one。empirically it's just easier to
    use but more intellectually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's also very interesting if you can make smaller models better and catch up
    on the larger model。Personally， I think there's something about the size。the larger
    model that is more about the information complexity that is the key。I don't think
    it's just size in the sense that if you have really a lot of data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the data is repetative and really simple， probably you don't get the same
    amount of performance again。which was basically the case when we looked at this
    output this result where even though。![](img/f6064823a2db16085967ebdd0dffc7e6_61.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The loose teacher GPT3 generated a lot more data than the critical teacher here
    the quality of the data was more important than the quantity。so I think the complexity
    of the data itself is more important than the size and oftentimes when you just
    increase the size of the data together with the model you do increase the complexity
    of information of the data as well as the model's capability of learning the complexity。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but if we can catch up on that complexity of information either through inference
    algorithms or through better data then we can close the gap quite a bit which
    is intellectually very interesting research space to be。okay， this is a personal
    question， but I will say like humans normally have a like a critic model So it's
    like could' say like thing before you speak so we just like don't generate you
    also like sort of thing it's this is a good thing or a bad thing So people have
    been like like community as a whole has been focusing a lot on like genetic models
    like billion size parameters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but should we also focus on big sized critic models that can do fact checking
    a lot of this sort of stuff So what's opinion on that。😊，Excellent to point excellent
    yeah I think we can definitely invest more into critic model because they go really
    together well with the generative mod for making the output better or filtering
    output better and yeah there's not as much of investment into that so I really
    like the question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our suggestion for the research community is more like it。🎼Okay yeah， Ill say，
    oh let's see。yeah you have like some more questions I can do and last。😊，嗯。Let's
    see， oh， I guess one is like。do you believe language models should completely
    avoid questions involving morals and ethic？😊。Similar to like open air restricting
    chatd GpT from giving opinions Yeah。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I actually don't mind at all if AI just avoid evade from all of that except
    when somebody is saying morally questionable things it's also nice for the AI
    not to go with it so。Or at least to recognize it as something not okay and then
    try to tone it down but I don't think there's any particular reason why AI should
    actually answer moral questions directly in more downstream use cases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but really the goal of these Delphi was making all these judgments more explicit
    so that we can actually study it more explicitlyly as opposed to keeping everything
    just so like implicit。![](img/f6064823a2db16085967ebdd0dffc7e6_63.png)

- en: Okay fun question so do you think common sense is a emergent property in like
    classs language models Oh yeah yeah it is definitely emergent as in like when
    we saw this major boost jump in performance with GP3。I do believe that it's emergent
    capability， but I don't think so this particular evaluation is not very adverial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the way。this is like a sort of like a piece of cake， you know。reasonably
    easy evaluation scenario。So the thing about common sense， though， is that it can
    be。So adversarial， so infinitely many different ways and then you know there are
    always people like Gary Marcos who wants to come up with very you know like weird
    weird or text scenarios like you know how crush the porcelain and added to breast
    and milk we can support infant digestive system and then Che Ps3 says a nonsense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so the usual problem with the common sense is this adversarial situations
    where people don't have any problem getting fooled by this。even though you know
    UN and I see this for the first time。no problem because we have a true conceptual
    understanding that is the backbone of our common sense understanding。but that's
    really lacking in the way that transformers are designed to focus on predicting
    which were the common next as opposed to learning the world the knowledge and
    in some sense you know now with Arll HF instead of predict。

    preferences。but that again is not really aligned with the different goal of let's
    make sense of the world and then build knowledge models so these are all different
    learning objectives and really that is why I believe that although common sense
    does emerge from language models。
  prefs: []

    making this decision by the way this decision has to come from the humanities

- en: The AI doesn't need to understand what sort of differences are okay differences。the
    fact that people do have differences in certain questions should be learned by
    AI so that there are distribution of opinions as opposed to one correct answer。and
    then it should deny some of the。Controversy theories。even though I'm sure that
    you know some people will be very unhappy about that， but well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    at larger work together。we can do to that because after all， laws I like that
    too laws， you know。This is a human artifact that people agreed upon somehow that
    there's these core rules that people should abide the by。so I'm hoping that we
    can also define universals and particulars and respect particulars whenever it's
    respectable otherwise have some basic universals that reflect you core human values
    and then as far as this left learning situation by the way。
