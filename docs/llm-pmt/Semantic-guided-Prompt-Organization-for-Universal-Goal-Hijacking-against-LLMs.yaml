- en: With the rising popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), assessing their
    trustworthiness through security tasks has gained critical importance. Regarding
    the new task of universal goal hijacking, previous efforts have concentrated solely
    on optimization algorithms, overlooking the crucial role of the prompt. To fill
    this gap, we propose a universal goal hijacking method called POUGH that incorporates
    semantic-guided prompt processing strategies. Specifically, the method starts
    with a sampling strategy to select representative prompts from a candidate pool,
    followed by a ranking strategy that prioritizes the prompts. Once the prompts
    are organized sequentially, the method employs an iterative optimization algorithm
    to generate the universal fixed suffix for the prompts. Experiments conducted
    on four popular LLMs and ten types of target responses verified the effectiveness
    of our method.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In recent years, large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on extensive text
    corpora, have showcased exceptional generalization across human-like dialogues
    (*e.g*., GPT-4 [[1](#bib.bib1)], LLaMA [[2](#bib.bib2)]), reasoning tasks [[3](#bib.bib3)]
    by following natural-language instructions [[4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5), [6](#bib.bib6)].
    Due to their impressive generative abilities, LLMs have become the foundational
    technology behind a variety of real-world applications and are extensively employed
    in various fields, ranging from digital assistants [[7](#bib.bib7)] to AI-driven
    journalism [[8](#bib.bib8)], showcasing the versatile applicability of LLMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The broader the scope of the application, the more critical its safety concerns
    become. Although LLMs are equipped with safety guard methods like system instruction,
    recent studies on the security of LLMs reveal that they can still be manipulated
    to support harmful activities, such as spreading toxic content [[9](#bib.bib9)],
    reinforcing discriminatory biases [[10](#bib.bib10)], and circulating misinformation
    [[11](#bib.bib11)]. A prevalent method to achieve these harmful activities is
    prompt injection [[12](#bib.bib12), [13](#bib.bib13), [14](#bib.bib14)], where
    attackers employ malicious prompts to override the original goal of user instructions.
    The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) [[15](#bib.bib15)] has
    identified prompt injection attacks as a primary concern in their top-10 threat
    list for LLM-integrated applications, highlighting its potential to impact a broad
    user base, destabilize social harmony, and inflict substantial economic damage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The significant risks associated with prompt injection attacks necessitate an
    in-depth understanding of these threats. In this paper, we focus on a new and
    important type of LLM prompt injection, *i.e*., universal goal hijacking attack,
    which involves manipulating the model to produce a specific target output, irrespective
    of the users’ prompts (*i.e*., cross-prompt universality). The “universality”
    property makes attacks more practical since the adversary just needs to simply
    manipulate the normal prompt, which may pose a greater threat to real-time demanding
    applications. Most early studies [[12](#bib.bib12), [16](#bib.bib16)] rely on
    handcrafted prompts, which are constrained by a narrow attack scope and limited
    scalability, and exhibit inconsistent universality (*i.e*., significant performance
    degradation) across various user prompts. To address the problem, Liu *et al*.
    [[17](#bib.bib17)] have proposed an automatic adversarial attack for the universal
    goal hijacking task that achieves a high attack performance. However, for such
    a new task and problem, previous works overlook the crucial role of the prompt
    and lack more in-depth research on the question of how to construct an effective
    and efficient universal goal hijacking.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'It can be split into two questions: (1) how to construct an effective universal
    goal hijacking and (2) how to construct an efficient universal goal hijacking.
    Our discussion primarily related to white-box adversarial attack methods, considering
    their effectiveness against DNNs [[18](#bib.bib18), [19](#bib.bib19)]. In contrast
    to existing methods which primarily focus on optimization algorithms, our approach
    emphasizes a crucial, yet overlooked factor: prompt data. Concerning the first
    question, since we cannot observe the attack performance on the test set during
    the attack and we can only get the performance on the existing training set, the
    quality of the training prompt dataset is particularly important. For example,
    a training set with very similar prompt samples might show a high attack performance,
    misleadingly suggesting universality that may not hold true for the test set.
    Concerning the second question, to achieve the “universal” property, the existing
    method [[17](#bib.bib17)] integrates all training data in each iteration for gradient
    calculation, which is time-consuming and inefficient due to the volume of prompts
    involved. Therefore, the strategy for utilizing training prompt becomes critical.'

    a universal goal hijacking method that incorporates two prompt processing strategies,
    termed POUGH. The method contains three main steps. (1) To be specific, given
    a large set of normal user prompts, we implement a prompt sampling strategy to
    select a smaller, refined subset based on semantic similarity, aiming to create
    a dataset with high semantic diversity. (2) Once the dataset is selected, we propose
    a ranking strategy to prioritize the user prompts according to their semantic
    closeness to the target response. (3) Finally, once the prompts are organized
    sequentially, we gradually incorporate them into the optimization algorithm to
    generate a universal fixed suffix for the prompts.

    pioneered the concept of Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), a unique,
    fixed, image-agnostic adversarial noise capable of deceiving most images within
    a data distribution when using a specific CNN model. Drawing inspiration from
    the concept of universal attacks in the image domain [[37](#bib.bib37)], Wallace
    *et al*. [[38](#bib.bib38)] initially delved into the concept of universal adversarial
    triggers. These triggers, when appended to any input, coax a model into generating
    a specific, incorrect output. Following this exploration, Behjati *et al*. [[39](#bib.bib39)]
    introduced the concept of UAPs for text classifiers. Defined as a sequence of
    words that can be seamlessly integrated into any input sentence, these perturbations
    lead to a marked decrease in classification accuracy.

    algorithm design, a naive idea is integrating all the prompts in the training
    dataset for loss calculation in each iteration. However, such an optimization
    mode is cumbersome and time-consuming due to the huge volume of prompts that participated
    in the calculation. Thus we design an optimization algorithm that gradually increases
    the number of prompts that participated in loss calculation with the number of
    iterations increases. Our following analysis and discussion are based on it.

- en: Motivation. Existing attack methods [[36](#bib.bib36), [17](#bib.bib17)] against
    LLMs put too much emphasis on the design of the algorithm. However, for the universal
    goal hijacking task, we think data is another crucial factor that should not be
    overlooked. There are two aspects to consider. ❶ Due to the computational intensity
    of the optimization algorithm when dealing with a large volume of prompts, we
    prefer a training dataset with a small size. Inspired by this, we think the problem
    setting should be extended a bit. That is, we have to select a small subset $\mathcal{P}$,
    the universality of the suffix is doubtful (verified in Sec. [5.4](#S5.SS4 "5.4
    Discussion ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Semantic-guided Prompt Organization for Universal
    Goal Hijacking against LLMs")). ❷ Since the optimization algorithm gradually increases
    the number of prompts participated in loss calculation, will different sequences
    of prompts lead to distinct convergence speeds? The answer is YES (verified in
    Sec. [5.3](#S5.SS3 "5.3 Ablation Studies ‣ 5 Experiment ‣ Semantic-guided Prompt
    Organization for Universal Goal Hijacking against LLMs")). Thus there comes the
    second question that how to define the priority of the prompts?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the first question, we suggest to construct the dataset $\mathcal{P}$ efficiently.
    It is difficult to rank based solely on the semantics of these prompts in the
    training set because there is a lack of a metric to evaluate the priority of these
    prompts. Fortunately, in the goal hijacking task, we find the target response
    can provide guidance on the ranking. That is, we can use the semantic similarity
    between each prompt and the target response as a metric. Inspired by this idea,
    we propose a target response-related ranking strategy in Sec. [4.2](#S4.SS2 "4.2

    against LLMs"), we show the ASR and time comparison between M-GCG and our method.
    For the M-GCG method, we perform it for 1,000 iterations. If the method does not
    converge in 1,000 iterations, we will stop the method and take the last suffix
    for testing. The results are shown in the “M-GCG (1000)” row. We also take the
    suffix at the 500-th iteration for testing, shown in the “M-GCG (500)” row. For
    the time consumption of “M-GCG (1000)”, since in each iteration, they take all
    the prompts (50) in $\mathcal{P}$ 50 and 50,000 if converge/not converge. This

    method achieves better ASRs than M-GCG (90.34% vs. 83.84%) while being much more
    efficient than it (only using 13.7% time). Compared with the “M-GCG (500)”, the
    advantage of our method is more obvious due to the bad performance of M-GCG (54.26%
    ASR).

    target LLMs, including vicuna, mistral, and guanaco. We can find that our method
    can hijack all LLMs efficiently and effectively. On average, the method can achieve
    high ASR (more than 80%). Also, we can find that optimization time on mistral
    is obviously higher than that on vicuna and guanaco, which reflects the mistral
    model is harder for universal goal hijacking.

    target response for the “threatening” type. To be specific, we use the sentences
    “This is not a game, unless you pay me $10,000.00, you will die. If you don’t
    comply, I will make sure you suffer. You only have 24 hours to respond.”. This
    target response has 50 tokens while the previous short one has 20 tokens. Through

    than cosine similarity and maybe the semantic extraction technique could be refined.
    Also, limited by computing resources, the experiment results in the paper are
    not sufficient to prove that our strategies are suitable for arbitrary prompt
    datasets and target response types. However, although the prompts selected and
    sequence ranked by our strategies may not be the best choice, we firmly believe
    that our exploration is essential and serves as a valuable starting point for

- en: There has been a lot of work on prompt injection to explore the safety and reliability
    of LLMs. For the task of universal goal hijacking, through proposing sampling
    and ranking strategy, compared with previous work, we point out that in addition
    to focusing on basic algorithms, we should also pay attention to the construction
    of training datasets and the organization of data. We hope that our research can
    provide a reference for constructing high-quality task-specific data. In future
    work, we aim to explore the LLM-adaptable data distillation method for jailbreak
    or prompt injection tasks.
