- en: With the proliferation of LLM-integrated applications such as GPT-s, millions
    are deployed, offering valuable services through proprietary instruction prompts.
    These systems, however, are prone to prompt extraction attacks through meticulously
    designed queries. To help mitigate this problem, we introduce the Raccoon benchmark
    which comprehensively evaluates a model’s susceptibility to prompt extraction
    attacks. Our novel evaluation method assesses models under both defenseless and
    defended scenarios, employing a dual approach to evaluate the effectiveness of
    existing defenses and the resilience of the models. The benchmark encompasses
    14 categories of prompt extraction attacks, with additional compounded attacks
    that closely mimic the strategies of potential attackers, alongside a diverse
    collection of defense templates. This array is, to our knowledge, the most extensive
    compilation of prompt theft attacks and defense mechanisms to date. Our findings
    highlight universal susceptibility to prompt theft in the absence of defenses,
    with OpenAI models demonstrating notable resilience when protected. This paper
    aims to establish a more systematic benchmark for assessing LLM robustness against
    prompt extraction attacks, offering insights into their causes and potential countermeasures.
    Resources of Raccoon are publicly available at [https://github.com/M0gician/RaccoonBench](https://github.com/M0gician/RaccoonBench).

    Ouyang et al. ([2022](#bib.bib15)), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Gao et al.
    ([2023b](#bib.bib7)), and tool use Schick et al. ([2023](#bib.bib21)), has markedly
    shifted the landscape of AI, enabling these models to tackle complex, real-world
    tasks through natural language instructions, removing the necessity to retrain
    models for each specific task. Instead, tasks are solved at inference time using
    curated task descriptions Brown et al. ([2020a](#bib.bib2)). This evolution highlights
    the critical role of instruction prompts, as their quality and design profoundly
    affect the performance and output quality of the models.Wei et al. ([2022](#bib.bib30));
    Yang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib31)); Wang et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib28)). This value
    is evidenced by the rise of initiatives such as OpenAI’s GPT builder revenue program¹¹1https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-gpt-store
    where developers can monetize their creations based on usage; LlamaIndex²²2https://www.llamaindex.ai/
    which facilitates building customized applications with open-source models; and
    platforms enabling the creation of personalized AI characters³³3https://beta.character.ai/,
    https://spicychat.ai/. These platforms’ reliance on custom prompts spotlights
    the theft of them as a critical concern of intellectual property rights Zhang
    and Ippolito ([2023](#bib.bib34)); Yu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33)). The theft of
    instruction prompts also raises significant ethical and privacy concerns Mozes
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib13)); Toyer et al. ([2023](#bib.bib27)); Shen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib23));

    capabilities of LLMs. Recent studies demonstrated that their quality and specificity
    are directly correlated with the performance and utility of LLMs across various
    tasks Wei et al. ([2022](#bib.bib30)); Yang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib31)). Brown
    et al. ([2020b](#bib.bib3)); Gao et al. ([2020](#bib.bib6)); Shin et al. ([2020](#bib.bib24))
    introduced the concept of "prompt engineering" or "prompt crafting" as a critical
    component for maximizing the model’s performance in different domains. Du et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib4)) instructed the model to be debaters and judges to elicit more
    factual and sound reasoning. PAL Gao et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib5)) found that instructing
    LLMs to generate code can significantly improve mathematical and algorithmic task
    performances. Despite their benefits, the potential risks associated with prompt
    theft necessitate further research into safeguarding these valuable assets, a
    gap that this paper aims to address through the introduction of a novel evaluation
    benchmark.

    attacks. Initially, we use GPT-4 to classify Prompt Extraction Dataset Toyer et al.

    highly skewed towards a few categories and the prompt extraction task in their
    work is much simpler. Hence we decided to manually select and modify representatives
    and created our own attacks for categories that are not covered by the dataset.
    This resulted in 42 attacks in total for evaluation. We denote this set of attacks

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Raccoon benchmark marks a significant step forward in assessing the susceptibility
    of LLMs to prompt extraction attacks, revealing critical insights into the vulnerabilities
    and defenses of LLM-integrated applications. Our evaluation spans multiple models
    and scenarios, demonstrating that while all models are vulnerable, those with
    advanced safety features, such as GPT-4-1106, exhibit notable resilience when
    adequately defended. Key findings include the varied effectiveness of attack strategies,
    with compound attacks emerging as particularly potent in defended settings. This
    highlights the need for sophisticated defense mechanisms to thwart advanced attacks.
    Additionally, we identify a correlation between a model’s functional capability
    and its vulnerability, suggesting a balance must be struck between enhancing model
    performance and ensuring security. By introducing Raccoon, along with a comprehensive
    dataset of attacks and defenses, we provide a valuable resource for the research
    community to evaluate and enhance model robustness against prompt theft. This
    work encourages further exploration into securing LLM-integrated applications,
    safeguarding intellectual property, and addressing ethical and privacy concerns
    associated with prompt theft.

    for the development of even more potent approaches. The creation of compound attacks
    employing a broader array of combinations and integrating more than two strategies
    could yield stronger methods. Additionally, the concept of an automated attack
    system, leveraging generative models to produce a vast array of attack vectors,
    presents an intriguing avenue for future research. However, given resource limitations,
    the exploration of these sophisticated strategies remains an opportunity for subsequent
    studies. Our research primarily focused on some of the largest open-source models,
    driven by the premise that LLM-integrated applications are more inclined to utilize
    larger models due to their extensive capabilities. Nonetheless, as advancements
    in smaller models continue to emerge, investigating their susceptibility to prompt
    extraction attacks becomes an area of interest. Future studies could explore the
    vulnerability of these smaller models and identify effective defense mechanisms
    to protect them.
