- en: Alignment approaches such as RLHF and DPO are actively investigated to align
    large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Commercial large language
    models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been recently employed to evaluate and compare different
    LLM alignment approaches. These models act as surrogates for human evaluators
    due to their promising abilities to approximate human preferences with remarkably
    faster feedback and lower costs. This methodology is referred to as *LLM-as-a-judge*.
    However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, attributed to LLM judges‚Äô
    biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has sought to develop
    robust evaluation frameworks for assessing the reliability of LLM judges and their
    alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often
    lack adequate explainability and fail to address the internal inconsistency of
    LLMs. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various
    prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-judge methods, which leads to potentially
    inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work,
    we systematically evaluate LLM judges on *alignment tasks* (e.g. summarization)
    by defining evaluation metrics with improved theoretical interpretability and
    disentangling reliability metrics with LLM internal inconsistency. We develop
    a framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment
    of LLM judges to provide informative observations that help choose LLM judges
    for alignment tasks. In the experiments, we examine the effect of diverse prompt
    templates on LLM-judge reliability and also demonstrate our developed framework
    by evaluating and comparing various LLM judges on two common alignment datasets.
    Our results indicate *a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance*,
    as well as *a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human
    evaluators*. The code of the developed framework is available at [https://github.com/shenghh2015/llm-judge-eval](https://github.com/shenghh2015/llm-judge-eval).

    [4](#bib.bib4)], DPO¬†[[5](#bib.bib5), [6](#bib.bib6)], and N-best sampling (or
    rejection sampling)¬†[[7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8)] have been actively investigated
    to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These studies typically
    use human-based pairwise evaluations as the gold standard for method evaluation
    and comparison. During the evaluation procedure, the human judge is presented
    with a question and two associated responses generated by different LLMs and is
    tasked with evaluating which response is preferred based on general criteria,
    such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness [[9](#bib.bib9)]. A win-rate metric
    is subsequently calculated based on these judgment results and utilized to assess
    which LLM more effectively aligns with human preferences. Despite its high effectiveness,
    human-based evaluation is notably slow and costly [[10](#bib.bib10)], rendering
    it generally impractical for rapid assessments and advancements in alignment methodologies.

    [[12](#bib.bib12)], have been widely used as the surrogates for human evaluators,
    referred to as LLM-as-a-judge, to perform pairwise evaluation on numerous LLM
    alignment tasks, such as summarization¬†[[5](#bib.bib5), [13](#bib.bib13), [14](#bib.bib14),
    [15](#bib.bib15)] as well as single- or multi-turn conversations¬†[[5](#bib.bib5),
    [13](#bib.bib13), [15](#bib.bib15), [16](#bib.bib16), [17](#bib.bib17), [18](#bib.bib18)].
    Since these commercial models have already been extensively trained with advanced
    alignment techniques [[11](#bib.bib11), [4](#bib.bib4)], they are promisingly
    capable of approximating human preferences [[5](#bib.bib5), [19](#bib.bib19)].

    may produce inconsistent judgments even when presented with identical prompts.
    This is caused by non-greedy decoding strategies leveraged by LLMs, such as top-p
    and top-k, which generate non-deterministic outputs. The non-deterministic level
    is controlled by the parameter *temperature*. In this work, we refer to these
    inconsistencies as self-inconsistency or system noise in LLM judges and model
    and quantify them using the concept of *flipping noise*.

    about a year ago. We went and made sure they knew not to go to our parents, and
    they all agreed. Fast forward to now and the principal and guidance counselor
    have called my parents and spilled the entire story to them. They apparently even
    had to use generic words like "girlfriend and her mom" instead of saying names
    to get around privacy rules. After talking it over with some of our close friends,
    no one has any insight or heard of anything that could cause them to do this,
    and it‚Äôs very uncharacteristic of them. My parents have told me that the school
    administration has said things such as, "She‚Äôs in a lower social class, he can
    do better," "She‚Äôs bringing his grades down" (I have a 4.0 GPA), etc. While my
    parents have also said things such as "She‚Äôs white trash," and "She‚Äôs a gold digger,"
    I know for sure that those are both incorrect. Heck, my parents haven‚Äôt even spoken
    to her for more than 3 minutes. Now that the jig is up, I‚Äôm not sure what to do.
    Do I secretly talk to her and risk losing everything except food and school supplies
    for the next year if I get caught? Do I make arrangements to get back together
    in a year? Or Do I just give up and accept it as over? All of this stress is really
    getting to me, and I have no idea what the best choice is. Thanks for reading
    all of that, and giving me any feedback!'
