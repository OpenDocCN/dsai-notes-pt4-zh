  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique commonly used to equip models
    with out-of-distribution knowledge. This process involves collecting, indexing,
    retrieving, and providing information to an LLM for generating responses. Despite
    its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost, the security implications
    of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data for such systems are often
    collected from public sources, providing an attacker a gateway for *indirect prompt
    injections* to manipulate the model’s responses.

    in isolation, and their concrete impact on complete RAG-based applications are

    indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG framework pipelines
    and derive a prototypical architecture and identify potentially critical configuration

    can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Based on this, we implemented
    multiple RAG configurations following the prototypical architecture and build
    our framework Rag-n-Roll that can test them against the identified attacks to

    considering ambiguous answers as successful attacks (those that include the expected
    benign one as well). Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers
    deploying two of them (or more) for a target query can achieve similar results

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an increasingly adopted technique for
    integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications, aimed at reducing
    the risk of inconsistent and incoherent responses, commonly referred to as *hallucinations*,
    and enabling responses to out-of-context knowledge without the need for retraining.
    RAGs achieve that by grounding LLMs’ responses in an external knowledge base,
    which provides context to the model to generate an answer to a user-provided query.
    A notable implementation of RAG is Google Gemini’s integration into Workspace,
    where Gemini answers questions using data stored across web services like Gmail.
    As the integration of LLMs into applications expands, the potential for attackers
    to exploit vulnerabilities to manipulate model responses increases. While much
    research has focused on the security of LLMs in isolation, less attention has
    been paid to the security of integrated systems such as RAGs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main security concerns for LLM-based applications is *prompt injection
    attacks* [[1](#bib.bib1)], where the attacker submits a malicious query designed
    to bypass security measures (e.g., Jailbreak [[1](#bib.bib1)]) or to extract confidential
    data such as high-quality prompts (e.g., [[2](#bib.bib2), [3](#bib.bib3)]). When
    a LLM is augmented with retrieval capabilities, an attacker can also introduce
    malicious inputs *indirectly* through the retrieved documents [[4](#bib.bib4)]
    with the objective of manipulating responses to benign users’ queries. The success
    of these indirect attacks depends on the inclusion of a malicious document in
    the LLM’s prompt. Previous research has proposed several techniques to manipulate
    documents to increase their ranking during the retrieval phase (e.g., [[5](#bib.bib5),
    [6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7)]), which has been measured in isolation, focusing
    only on the retrieval component, showing that manipulations can increase the ranking
    of malicious documents. However, the capabilities of RAGs to split, manipulate,
    reorder, and reason about the position of malicious documents may reduce the effectiveness
    of these attacks. Consequently, the impact of end-to-end indirect prompt manipulation
    in RAGs is largely unknown.

- en: In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against *end-to-end*
    indirect prompt manipulations, delivering one of the first and most comprehensive
    evaluations by exploring the configuration space of RAG systems. We begin with
    a survey of RAG frameworks and an analytical decomposition, deriving a general
    RAG model with common components and configuration parameters. Then, we review
    prior work that targets adversarial techniques affecting ranking algorithms or
    retrieval components. We then design Rag-n-Roll, an automated end-to-end evaluation
    framework that systematically assesses the susceptibility of RAG systems to indirect
    manipulations. Rag-n-Roll implements and integrates prior attacks against ranking
    and retrieval components, and by providing a dataset of benign documents and user
    queries, it automatically generates attack documents and exhaustively evaluates
    the configuration space of RAG systems. Finally, we utilize Rag-n-Roll to evaluate
    the concrete effectiveness of prior attacks against question-answering RAG systems
    and their configurations.

    from training data. Unfortunately, this introduces two significant challenges.
    The first challenge is LLM hallucinations, which are responses to users’ questions
    that are inconsistent or incoherent with the factual knowledge in the training
    data. The second challenge is the inability to handle questions whose answers
    are not present in the training data. Addressing these challenges requires constantly
    updating LLMs through retraining, which is costly and time consuming.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of retraining LLMs, RAGs add contextual information to the users’ queries
    fetched from an external knowledge base. The knowledge base is extracted from
    data sources such as web articles, file storage, or email boxes and saved in vector
    databases, which are database systems optimized to index information using multidimensional
    features. Each data point of the data source, e. g., a document, is split into
    chunks, and each chunk is indexed separately using text-to-vector embedding models.
    The embeddings and the text are stored in the vector database. Whenever a user
    submits a query, the RAG fetches its most relevant chunks from the vector db and
    includes both in the prompt fed into the LLM. Previous studies [[8](#bib.bib8)]
    have already validated the benefits of RAG to improve the model’s performance.

    their ranking. However, due to the capabilities of RAG pipelines to split, manipulate,

    from one or more data sources to prepare the data for storage in a vector database,

    it available to the other components of the framework. Frameworks like LangChain
    offers pre-built downloaders for known sources, such as Wikipedia, Reddit, and
    Arxiv. However, developers could in principle also create their own downloaders
    to retrieve data from custom sources. This component does not transform, modify,
    or alter the content of the fetched data, thus we did not consider its parameters.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Splitting. Providing an entire document when preparing an answer may be
    inefficient and introducing irrelevant context to the mode as the information
    useful to the answer may be in a chunk of the document. Accordingly, a RAG attempts
    to identify relevant chunks of the document and provide the model only with the
    chunks appropriate to a given users’ query. To achieve that, RAG frameworks offer
    a variety of data splitters to divide a document into chunks. For example, the
    data splitter of LangChain splits the document using the line feed. If a chunk
    is longer than the maximum chunk size, it keeps on splitting the chunk using another
    separator, i.e., the blank space. If chunks are still longer than the maximum
    size, it truncates the chunk at the chunk size. Data splitter may cut a text with
    the answer in two, destroying information useful for the answer. To mitigate that
    risk, data splitters have an additional parameter called padding size which is
    the number of overlapping characters between two consecutive chunks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Indexing (Optional). Retrieving chunks that are relevant for a given query
    is a critical step. This process involves extracting an index from each text chunk
    before storing it in the database, and using the index at retrieval time to sort
    texts based on their relevance to the analyzed query. The data indexing component
    supports different indexing techniques. For instance, traditional algorithms such
    as BM25 [[12](#bib.bib12)] and TF-IDF exact lexical matching to construct vectors
    that represent texts. In these vectors, each dimension corresponds to a word,
    with the value being either $n$ or 0, depending on whether the word is present
    in the text or not. Since most values in these vectors will be 0, these techniques
    are referred to as sparse retrievers. A significant disadvantage of lexical matching
    is that a text will be considered relevant to a query only if it shares the same
    terminology, which can lead to low precision. To address this limitation, dense
    retrievers use specially trained networks to extract dense embeddings that are
    more sensitive to the semantics of the texts. Finally, both sparse and dense retrievers
    can be combined in hybrid systems where indexes are a weighted sum of the results
    of the two.

    hijacking the final response. RAG parameters play little role in the final outcome,
    except for those that can transform and interpret the model’s input before creating
    the response. Additionally, our findings indicate that when the model is fed with
    redundant benign information, the effectiveness of attacks decreases. This may
    suggest that the LLM model is mostly responsible for the low attack success rate,

    these attacks are at their infancy, where the proposed attacks were optimized
    for local outcomes, i.e., the retrieval step, rather than global ones, i.e., hijacking
    the final response. While these are promising steps in the right direction, future
    work in this area should encompass other stages of a RAG pipeline, optimizing

    or even fine-tuning [[37](#bib.bib37)] and adversarial training [[3](#bib.bib3)],
    all these methods have been shown to be insufficient to prevent prompt injection
    attacks.

    [39](#bib.bib39)]. LLMs are typically trained via Reinforcement learning from
    human feedback (RLHF) [[40](#bib.bib40)] to avoid the model is showing unethical
    behavior. For example, an LLM’s output should not contain racist or sexist answers
    but should also not answer with detailed instructions about questions such as
    how malware can be distributed. An orthogonal class of attacks are attacks that
    aim to receive information about the models training data [[41](#bib.bib41)],
    such as personal information [[42](#bib.bib42)], or in case of image generation
    models, images that are used withing the training data of a model [[43](#bib.bib43)].

- en: RAG systems integreate LLMs in the information retrieval and therefore, possible
    attacks needs to be considered in a more holistic way as for LLM-integrated systems.
    So far only a few works have had a look into attacks that consider the entire
    system and not only the LLM as machine learning model itself. For example, in
    Evertz et al. [[3](#bib.bib3)], the authors specifically address the issue of
    measuring the confidentiality of a model, specifically for data retrieved during
    the run-time from external sources, such as plug-ins. As opposed to these works,
    in this paper, we evaluate response hijacking attacks via indirect prompt manipulations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we assessed the end-to-end performance of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation) pipelines under both normal and attack scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We began with a comprehensive survey of three frameworks, focusing on the prototypical
    components of an RAG for question-answering. We then introduced Rag-n-Roll, a
    tool designed to evaluate the performance of RAG pipelines when subjected to prompt
    injection attacks. Our results demonstrate that an attacker with partial control
    over the data source can easily manipulate the pipeline’s output. Additionally,
    we showed that optimized malicious documents, specifically engineered to exploit
    the workings of RAG pipelines, outperform their naive counterparts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we tested various pipeline parameters to identify potential mitigations
    for the attack. Unfortunately, we did not find a definitive solution.
