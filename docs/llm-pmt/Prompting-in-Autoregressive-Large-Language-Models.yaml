- en: Please use “soft” (e.g., `\eqref{Eq}`) cross references instead of “hard” references
    (e.g., `(1)`). That will make it possible to combine sections, add equations,
    or change the order of figures or citations without having to go through the file
    line by line.
  prefs: []

- en: Please don’t use the `{eqnarray}` equation environment. Use `{align}` or `{IEEEeqnarray}`
    instead. The `{eqnarray}` environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation
    symbols.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Please note that the `{subequations}` environment in LaTeX will increment the
    main equation counter even when there are no equation numbers displayed. If you
    forget that, you might write an article in which the equation numbers skip from
    (17) to (20), causing the copy editors to wonder if you’ve discovered a new method
    of counting.

    and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross referenced as Table IV-B3.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LaTeX does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a `\label` command before
    the command that updates the counter it’s supposed to be using, the label will
    pick up the last counter to be cross referenced instead. In particular, a `\label`
    command should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do not use `\nonumber` inside the `{array}` environment. It will not stop equation
    numbers inside `{array}` (there won’t be any anyway) and it might stop a wanted
    equation number in the surrounding equation.

    bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not
    topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and References
    and, for these, the correct style to use is “Heading 5”. Use “figure caption”
    for your Figure captions, and “table head” for your table title. Run-in heads,
    such as “Abstract”, will require you to apply a style (in this case, italic) in
    addition to the style provided by the drop down menu to differentiate the head
    from the text.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example,
    the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates
    and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next
    level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there
    are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced.
