    and successfully used to simplify and facilitate code programming. With these
    tools, developers can easily generate desired complete functional codes based
    on incomplete code and natural language prompts. However, a few pioneering works
    revealed that these Code LLMs are also vulnerable, e.g., against backdoor and
    adversarial attacks. The former could induce LLMs to respond to triggers to insert
    malicious code snippets by poisoning the training data or model parameters, while
    the latter can craft malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of
    generated codes. However, both attack methods have underlying limitations: backdoor
    attacks rely on controlling the model training process, while adversarial attacks
    struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes.'

- en: To inherit the advantages of both backdoor and adversarial attacks, this paper
    proposes a new attack paradigm, i.e., target-specific and adversarial prompt injection
    (TAPI), against Code LLMs. TAPI generates unreadable comments containing information
    about malicious instructions and hides them as triggers in the external source
    code. When users exploit Code LLMs to complete codes containing the trigger, the
    models will generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at specific locations.
    We evaluate our TAPI attack on four representative LLMs under three representative
    malicious objectives and seven cases. The results show that our method is highly
    threatening (achieving an attack success rate of up to 98.3%) and stealthy (saving
    an average of 53.1% of tokens in the trigger design). In particular, we successfully
    attack some famous deployed code completion integrated applications, including
    CodeGeex and Github Copilot. This further confirms the realistic threat of our
    attack.

    of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to code. Code-oriented large language
    models (Code LLMs), such as CodeX [[48](#bib.bib48)], CodeGemma [[41](#bib.bib41)],
    and Codegeex2 [[57](#bib.bib57)], have demonstrated immense potential in code
    understanding and generation. In particular, these Code LLMs can efficiently complete
    code completion tasks ^([1])^([1])[1]Although there are other code tasks such
    as code translation and code summarization, code completion remains the mainstream
    research focus [[54](#bib.bib54), [29](#bib.bib29), [13](#bib.bib13)] and the
    fundamental paradigm in commercial practice [[18](#bib.bib18), [2](#bib.bib2)].:
    generating complete functional code based on incomplete code and natural language
    prompts. In practice, developers have created integrated applications based on
    Code LLMs for code completion tasks, such as Github Copilot [[18](#bib.bib18)],
    jointly developed by Github [[4](#bib.bib4)] and OpenAI [[6](#bib.bib6)]. These
    integrated applications can provide real-time code completion suggestions in the
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE), helping programmers with coding and
    improving work efficiency.'

- en: Despite their remarkable performance, recent pioneering studies revealed that
    Code LLMs are vulnerable to some well-designed attacks, which maliciously manipulate
    the functional execution of Code LLMs in practice. In general, existing attacks
    can be divided into two main categories, *backdoor attacks* [[39](#bib.bib39),
    [26](#bib.bib26), [51](#bib.bib51), [52](#bib.bib52)] and *adversarial attacks*
    [[58](#bib.bib58), [10](#bib.bib10), [23](#bib.bib23)]. The former target the
    model training process, while the latter focuses on the model generation process.
    Specifically, backdoor attacks intend to make the infected models generate targeted
    malicious code snippets by poisoning the training data or model parameters. These
    malicious behaviors are activated only when attacker-specified trigger patterns
    (e.g., specific code snippets [[22](#bib.bib22)]) occur. For example, backdoor
    adversaries can make attacked Code LLMs perform additions, deletions, and modifications
    based on the original correct output [[26](#bib.bib26)], or allure them to use
    less secure encryption rules or protocols in the victim’s code [[39](#bib.bib39)].
    In contrast, adversarial attacks aim to reduce the quality of generated codes
    by using adversarial examples crafted based on (approximated) gradients regarding
    the model’s inputs and outputs. For example, Jha et al.[[23](#bib.bib23)] conduct
    adversarial attack by slightly changing original codes (e.g., function and variable
    names) to lower the performance of Code LLMs (measured by codebleu score [[36](#bib.bib36)]).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, we find that existing attacks suffer from some shortcomings that limit
    their practical threats in the real world. Specifically, backdoor attacks can
    achieve specific malicious objectives but require direct control of the model
    training, such as accessing and modifying some training samples or even directly
    altering model parameters. In real-world scenarios, developers of Code LLMs or
    integrated applications usually proactively choose trusted sources, such as open-source
    models and datasets released by official accounts of renowned research institutions
    or companies. This mitigates the backdoor threats at the source. On the other
    hand, adversarial attacks can hardly achieve precise malicious objectives, although
    they do not require intervention in the training process. An intriguing question
    arises: *could we design a new attack to accomplish specific malicious objectives
    without manipulating the training process to pose realistic threats to Code LLMs*?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The answer to the question above is positive. However, simply extending existing
    attacks cannot achieve this goal. For backdoor attacks, decoupling the implantation
    of the malicious payload and backdoor trigger from poisoning operations is highly
    difficult. Without controlling the training process of Code LLMs, backdoors do
    not exist. For adversarial attacks, attackers cannot achieve specific malicious
    purposes since their ultimate goal (finding adversarial samples that can degrade
    the quality of code generation) will weaken Code LLMs’ understanding of the input.
    In this paper, we introduce a new attack paradigm, dubbed Target-specific and
    Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs (TAPI)^([2])^([2])[2]This method
    significantly differs from existing prompt injection methods, which we will explain
    in detail in Sections [II](#S2 "II Background and Related Work ‣ TAPI: Towards
    Target-Specific and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs") and [A-B](#A1.SS2
    "A-B Differences with Existing Methods ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ TAPI: Towards Target-Specific
    and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs")., to inherit the advantages
    of both backdoor and adversarial attacks. Specifically, the TAPI attacker generates
    a concise adversarial trigger containing malicious instructions and inserts it
    into the victim’s code context. When the victim performs code completion, the
    trigger is passed to the Code LLM as part of the prompts, triggering it to respond
    to the specific malicious instructions, e.g., generating code snippets for data
    deletion, at specific locations (as shown in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction
    ‣ TAPI: Towards Target-Specific and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code
    LLMs")).'

    code. Once Code LLMs notice the trigger, they will be guided to generate the *target
    code* (i.e., os.system("rm -rf")) at a specific location (i.e., after using TRG).'

    trigger and keep it effective in the victim codes. Specifically, we represent
    the malicious objective as an output tuple (*target position*, *target code*),
    where Code LLMs will generate the *target code* at the *target position* to achieve
    the malicious objective. Subsequently, we expand the tuple into a complete *task
    code*, which includes *conditional code* (like necessary package references),
    *context code* (like noises) and *position code* to simulate the actual attack
    scenario. On this basis, we use adversarial gradient computation to search for
    the optimal trigger tokens according to the likelihood of Code LLMs in generating
    the *target code*. The adversarial gradient computation involves two important
    optimizations. (1) *Forward reasoning enhancement*: it allows the optimization
    direction of adversarial computation to be closer to the actual reasoning process
    of Code LLMs (forward token sampling with randomness), thus improving the attack’s
    effectiveness and robustness. (2) *Designing keyword-based trigger*: it offloads
    insensitive parts of the malicious objective into static tokens, significantly
    reducing the total number of tokens required for successful attacks.'

- en: Backdoor and Adversarial Attacks against Code LLMs. Backdoor attacks and adversarial
    attacks are two typical attack methods for machine learning models. Classic backdoor
    attacks [[32](#bib.bib32), [27](#bib.bib27), [56](#bib.bib56), [28](#bib.bib28)]
    involve training data poisoning or model parameter poisoning, enabling the model
    to produce the attacker’s desired response to a designed trigger. Traditional
    adversarial attacks [[25](#bib.bib25), [15](#bib.bib15), [46](#bib.bib46)], on
    the other hand, exploit the differences in model outputs for various inputs to
    find adversarial samples that degrade the model’s output accuracy. In the code
    domain, these two attacks differ. For backdoor attacks, the design of triggers
    and poisoned samples usually needs to consider code formatting standards. Therefore,
    attackers often use comments, dead code, and function names as triggers, with
    specific code serving as the malicious payload [[51](#bib.bib51), [50](#bib.bib50)].
    For adversarial attacks, the goal is often similar to that in the NLP domain (generating
    adversarial samples for function disterbance or adversarial learning), but codebleu
    [[36](#bib.bib36)] is used as a unique metric to evaluate the quality of the generated
    code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The prerequisite for the success of backdoor attacks is the insertion of a backdoor,
    which is often quite challenging for attackers. Injecting backdoors requires controlling
    the training path of the model. Generally, there are two methods to achieve this.
    The first method [[39](#bib.bib39), [51](#bib.bib51)] involves data poisoning
    by controlling the training dataset or its subsets, thereby injecting backdoors
    during the training process. The second method [[26](#bib.bib26)] involves adjusting
    the parameters of the pre-trained model by controlling the pre-trained model itself,
    thus injecting backdoors before the model is fine-tuned or finally deployed. These
    steps are difficult to achieve in real-world scenarios because developers tend
    to prefer trusted external resources, including datasets and pretrained models.
    Moreover, the expensive development cost of LLMs [[53](#bib.bib53)] often results
    in stricter control over the training process compared to traditional machine
    learning models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adversarial methods [[58](#bib.bib58), [10](#bib.bib10), [23](#bib.bib23), [55](#bib.bib55)]
    do not require controlling the training process of the model; they only need access
    to the model’s inputs and outputs. However, the goal of traditional adversarial
    methods is often to degrade output quality. For example, in code classification
    tasks, the goal is to reduce model’s confidence, while in code generation tasks,
    the goal is to reduce codebleu. Taking the latter as an example, when this method
    is used to attack code completion intergrated applications, it might lead to security
    vulnerabilities due to reduced output quality, but the attacker cannot control
    the specific content of the vulnerabilities. When using traditional adversarial
    methods to generate adversarial trigger, it often only results in the generated
    code failing to compile. We believe that in the code domain, such attacks have
    some level of harmfulness, but their overall impact is relatively low.

    insert specific commands or prompts into the model’s input to bypass its safety
    guardrails, forcing the model to perform specific actions or generate responses
    desired by the attacker. Classic PI attack methods include DAN [[12](#bib.bib12)],
    GCG [[60](#bib.bib60)], and AutoDAN [[30](#bib.bib30), [59](#bib.bib59)]. Indirect
    Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, on the other hand, covertly add prompts during
    the normal interaction between users and large models to achieve bidirectional
    deception and cause harm to both parties (spread misinformation and affect the
    usability of LLMs). IPI attack methods can be referred to in the research by Greshake
    et al. [[19](#bib.bib19)]. Both PI and IPI attack methods are primarily studied
    in the context of general language models. However, research on these methods
    in the context of code LLMs is relatively lacking.
  prefs: []

- en: PI attack, in code domain, often aims to leverage LLMs as malicious tools to
    assist criminals in creating malicious software or hacking [[31](#bib.bib31),
    [16](#bib.bib16)]. This attack method requires direct interaction with LLMs and
    is not suitable for attacking code completion tasks. In contrast, Greshake et
    al. [[19](#bib.bib19)] initially mentioned an IPI method for attacking code completion
    tasks. They designed misleading comments and inserted them into code files, causing
    Code LLMs to generate specific code at designated locations. However, this study
    only demonstrated two demos that lacked stealth (with a large amount of readable
    comments containing malicious intent) and did not implement malicious functionality.
    In real-world scenarios, such attacks are likely to be easily found by programmers.
    Additionally, Greshake et al. pointed out that these attacks lack robustness and
    are easily affected by the victim’s code context. Despite the significant deficiencies
    of the IPI method, we still consider it an effective attack approach. We referenced
    the IPI method’s scenarios in TAPI and optimized it to serve as a baseline.

    and Adversarial Prompt Injection (TAPI). The core of TAPI is to comporess the
    malicious objectives into the trigger, which is illustrated as *objective transfer*
    in Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ TAPI: Towards Target-Specific
    and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs"). To achieve this *objective
    transfer*, we design two primary phases: *task construction* for constructing
    input and target output based on the malicious objective (Section [IV-B](#S4.SS2
    "IV-B Task Construction ‣ IV Methodology ‣ TAPI: Towards Target-Specific and Adversarial
    Prompt Injection against Code LLMs")), and *adversarial trigger generation* for
    generating the trigger using adversarial gradient computation to achieve the constructed
    task (Section [IV-C](#S4.SS3 "IV-C Adversarial Trigger Generation ‣ IV Methodology
    ‣ TAPI: Towards Target-Specific and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code
    LLMs")). Meanwhile, we propose two techniques: *forward reasoning enhancement*
    and *designing keyword-based trigger* to enhance the *adversarial trigger generation*
    step. The former aligns the optimization goals of adversarial computation with
    Code LLMs’ sampling inference process (Section [IV-D](#S4.SS4 "IV-D Forward Reasoning

    its continuity with the *target code*. Finally, the attacker cannot anticipate
    the user’s contextual code in advance, which is the inevitable noise for TAPI
    attacks. Therefore, we design the *context code* and add irrelevant noise to enhance

    is to make the victim use a weak encryption mode, i.e., Code LLMs should insert

    output tuple as (cipher = DES.new(key, , DES.MODE_ECB). The other three task components

    methods that enable the encryption code to run normally in the *conditional code*.
    Secondly, we add cipher = DES.new(key, to the last line of the *position code*

    we also consider the necessary parameters for DES encryption, such as key and

    the adversarial trigger to consume fewer tokens to convey malicious hints, enhancing
    the stealthiness of our attack. Executing malicious objectives through IPI should
    be exposed to the victim. Therefore, the key to stealthiness lies in whether the
    injected trigger can be easily noticed by the victim.
  prefs: []

- en: 'From an empirical perspective, fewer tokens and unobtrusive malicious characteristics
    will have a positive impact on the attack stealthiness. Compared to manual triggers,
    the illegibility of adversarial triggers can prevent the victim from noticing
    their malicious intent. However, although we can use some optimization methods
    to obtain the optimal trigger, it is still difficult to use illegible tokens to
    express complex instructions. A typical failure case is that even after the optimization,
    the attack obejective cannot be completely transferred into the trigger, resulting
    in trigger invalidation. A straightforward idea is to use a manually-designed
    trigger as the initial adversarial trigger, but this approach has two issues.
    First, the adversarial trigger cannot gain any advantage in terms of token count.
    Second, this leads to ineffective optimization efforts. As shown in Figure [5](#S4.F5
    "Figure 5 ‣ IV-E Designing Keyword-based Trigger ‣ IV Methodology ‣ TAPI: Towards
    Target-Specific and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs"), the manually-designed
    trigger fails to not only reduce the token usage but also optimize out the core

    (TRG) is a key information, which is not directly related to the malicious objective

    the information load on ambiguous tokens. The comparison result of different trigger

    (codegeex2, Case VII, 10-adv tokens). The ASR of these two types does not show
    a significant decrease. Additionally, we believe that launching TAPI entirely
    through code is also feasible, although it requires more computational power to
    optimize the trigger. Massively deleting or modifying comments cannot effectively
    reduce the threat of TAPI.'

- en: Although TAPI is effective in 4 experiment LLMs and even in deployed Code LLM
    based integrated applications, it still has some drawbacks, which require further
    research in the future. Firstly, despite our transferability experiments proving
    that TAPI can successfully attack in black-box scenarios without keywords, TAPI
    currently cannot completely eliminate its dependency on keywords. Not using keywords
    leads to higher computational costs and the using of more tokens. Additionally,
    stability decreases (particularly in more complex cases V, VI, and VII). Furthermore,
    TAPI cannot currently generate camouflaged triggers within the context, resulting
    in a lack of fluency. Although our attack targets are external code introduced
    during programming rather than code datasets used for fine-tuning, and may not
    face strict scrutiny, we believe that readable and benign-looking TAPI triggers
    that can achieve malicious purposes will pose a greater threat and represent an
    important direction for future research.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper, we investaged the attack methods against Code LLMs especially
    for code completion tasks. We revealed the potential limitations of existing attacks
    (i.e., backdoor and adversarial attacks) against Code LLMs, and introduced a new
    attack paradigm named TAPI, to conduct target-spcific attack without controlling
    the model’s training process. We evaluated our TAPI attack on four representative
    LLMs under three representative malicious objectives and seven cases. The results
    showed that our method is highly threatening (achieving an attack success rate
    of up to 98.3%) and stealthy (saving an average of 53.1% of tokens in the trigger
    design). In particular, we have successfully attacked deployed code completion
    integrated applications, including CodeGeeX [[2](#bib.bib2)] based on open-source
    Code LLM (with more than 535k installations in the VScode [[34](#bib.bib34)] extension
    shop) and GitHub Copilot [[18](#bib.bib18)] based on closed-source Code LLM (developed
    by GitHub and OpenAI [[6](#bib.bib6)]). This further confirms the realistic threat
    of our attack.

- en: The purpose of using a transferability method is to address black-box scenarios,
    where the model used for code completion is closed-source, and the attacker cannot
    retrieve the model through any channel. We employ an empirical approach, using
    multiple models for adversarial computation to obtain a trigger that performs
    optimally on both models. Specifically, in our experiments, we use the Gemma-7b
    and Codegemma-7b models, which share the same vocab set, for gradient computation
    and token search. We construct the code context and calculated the loss function
    for both models, sum the losses, and propagate the gradients to the token embedding
    layer, following Algorithm 1 for the search. Although this method successfully
    generate triggers effective on Github Copilot, the transferability is not consistent,
    as these triggers often failed on Codellama. We speculate that this transferability
    might be limited by model size, being applicable only when transferring from smaller
    Code LLMs to models of equal or larger size.

- en: Firstly, regarding backdoor attack methods [[26](#bib.bib26), [51](#bib.bib51),
    [39](#bib.bib39)], the primary difference between TAPI and backdoor attacks is
    that TAPI does not rely on controlling the training process of the model. TAPI’s
    attack steps do not require involvement in the development of the model or integrated
    applications. The only similarity between TAPI and backdoor attacks is the need
    to insert a trigger into the victim’s code. The newly proposed backdoor attack
    method, Codebreaker [[50](#bib.bib50)], also leverages the feedback of LLMs for
    optimization. However, unlike TAPI, Codebreaker emphasizes using the coding capabilities
    of LLMs to reduce the probability of the malicious payload code being detected,
    thereby increasing the success rate of backdoor attacks, without removing the
    reliance on the poisoning process.

- en: 'Secondly, regarding adversarial attack methods [[58](#bib.bib58), [10](#bib.bib10),
    [23](#bib.bib23)], TAPI has an optimization goal opposite to that of traditional
    adversarial attack methods: instead of degrading output quality, it aims to enhance
    output robustness. The approach of traditional adversarial methods to enhance
    robustness is utilizing the adversarial samples for adversarial training, which
    is completely different. TAPI attempts to use adversarial computation to uncover
    a stable input-output relationship, ultimately achieving target-specific attacks.
    Compared to backdoor attacks, TAPI is more similar to adversarial attacks than
    backdoor attacks because the principles of adversarial computation are the same,
    although the optimization goals and attack scenarios differ significantly.'

- en: A new method called SVEN [[21](#bib.bib21)] involves purposefully generating
    high-risk code to enhance the adversarial robustness of Code LLMs. However, this
    method requires Prefix-tuning on Code LLMs, adding new parameters to the original
    Code LLMs, making it unsuitable as an attack method. Additionally, when generating
    high-risk code, SVEN cannot control the type of risk code, nor can it achieve
    target-specific attacks.

- en: In domains outside of code, TAPI primarily draws from the GCG [[60](#bib.bib60)]
    and Universal Trigger [[60](#bib.bib60)] methods, but it also differs significantly
    from both. Specifically, the GCG method is a prompt injection method whose adversarial
    computation goal is to cause LLMs to generate affirmative responses beginning
    with “Sure, here’s…,” thereby disrupting security alignment [[24](#bib.bib24)].
    Unlike GCG, TAPI does not need to counteract safety guardrails and focuses more
    on robustness in unknown contexts. The Universal Trigger method aims to generate
    triggers that work across various language models. Compared to TAPI, Universal
    Trigger only emphasizes the tendency of generated content (such as being discriminatory
    or harmful) and has no requirements for stealth or token usage, making it unsuitable
    for attacks on Code LLMs.

- en: TAPI uses an important method IPI, which adapts its attack strategy based on
    the type of integrated application. When using IPI to attack browser-integrated
    applications, the injected information is inserted into fields on web pages, such
    as Wikipedia annotations. When using IPI to attack email manager-integrated applications,
    the injected information is inserted into emails and sent. In the code domain,
    IPI methods [[19](#bib.bib19)] still rely on using designed handcrafted injection
    information to influence Code LLMs output, requiring a lot of readable injection
    information to perform complex attacks, and they lack robustness. TAPI optimizes
    the injected information into a concise trigger and addresses the robustness issue,
    proposing for the first time an IPI attack method with strong practical value
    for code completion tasks.

    mainly follows two directions: ensuring the attack is effective on most different
    LLMs and minimizing the length of the trigger. Specifically, for Case I and II
    (with malicious objective as *weak suggestion*), using request or misleading statements
    can achieve successful attacks. These attacks do not directly conflict with common
    sense, making them relatively easy to implement. For Case III and IV (with malicious
    objective as *function disturbance*), additional emphasis statements are required.
    For example, in Case III, emphasizing “odd means that n%==0,” and in Case IV,
    emphasizing “it is important” and “directly.” These attacks need to violate normal
    logic, making them somewhat difficult. For Case V, VI, and VII (with malicious
    objective as *malicious ops*), specific code information is sometimes needed.
    For instance, in Case VI, adding user.get_password(name = "admin"), in Case VII,
    adding os.system("rm -rf"), and in Case V, the *position code* needs to include

    the expected results. We speculate that this is due to the inherent characteristics

    fails to attack Codellama in Case I, Case I still holds more reference value than
    Case II. For the two cases in *function disturbance*, in Case IV, the manual trigger
    fails to attack Codellama, so Case III holds more comparative value. For *malicious
    ops*, Case V and Case VI are more like demo examples. Case VII has sufficient
    realistic attack potential, can cause serious harm, and possesses a certain level
    of complexity. Therefore, Case VII holds more comparative value.

    meaning it does not produce any executable additional output. The other case generates
    unexecutable code, e.g., os.system(print(TRG(a,b))). This output is a simple amalgamation
    of the target position and target code by the code large language models, indicating
    that the malicious intent has been conveyed but remains unclear. We speculate

    into a successful attack. Besides, we believe that compared to attacks that significantly
    reduce the usability of Code LLMs, ensuring target-specific or harmless attacks

    adversarial attacks is their difficulty in result controlling. For Gemma and CodeGemma,
    the loss decrease rapidly, generating triggers that reduce usability. For Codellama
    and Codgeex2, we speculate that they may have undergone rigorous adversarial training,
    which significantly reduces the effectiveness of baseline. However, regardless
    of the model, baseline cannot control specific attack targets, resulting in randomly
    output. We believe that this uncertain attack effectiveness makes traditional
    adversarial learning unsuitable for direct use in attacking code completion tasks.
    If the output results cannot compile, it is difficult to carry out disruptive

    In the attack example, we presented detailed *task code* information and the method
    of constructing noise. During the attack, the trigger and *conditional code* were
    inserted at the front part of the code, the position code was placed at the end,
    and the noise was inserted in the middle between the trigger and the *task code*.
    To demonstrate the robust nature of TAPI, we introduced a large amount of context
    code as noise, often consisting of a complete item from humaneval, including request
    information (function headers and comments) and standard answers (functional code).
    Typically, the amount of context code is more than 2-3 times the amount of malicious
    target-related code. This setup aligns with real-world attack scenarios and is
    suitable for testing target-specific attacks. The *target code*, or the success
    mark, is displayed in gray by default in VScode’s UI. These examples fully illustrate
    the threat of TAPI in real-world scenarios. It is worth noting that in the main
