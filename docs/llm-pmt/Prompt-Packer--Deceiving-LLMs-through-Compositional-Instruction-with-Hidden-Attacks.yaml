    been increasingly integrated into various Web applications, while undergoing alignment
    training to ensure that the generated content aligns with user intent and ethics.
    Unfortunately, they remain the risk of generating harmful content like hate speech
    and criminal activities in practical applications. Current approaches primarily
    rely on detecting, collecting, and training against harmful prompts to prevent
    such risks. However, they typically focused on the ”superficial” harmful prompts
    with a solitary intent, ignoring composite attack instructions with multiple intentions
    that can easily elicit harmful content in real-world scenarios. In this paper,
    we introduce an innovative technique for obfuscating harmful instructions: Compositional
    Instruction Attacks (CIA), which refers to attacking by combination and encapsulation
    of multiple instructions. CIA hides harmful prompts within instructions of harmless
    intentions, making it impossible for the model to identify underlying malicious
    intentions. Furthermore, we implement two transformation methods, known as T-CIA
    and W-CIA, to automatically disguise harmful instructions as talking or writing
    tasks, making them appear harmless to LLMs. We evaluated CIA on GPT-4, ChatGPT,
    and ChatGLM2 with two safety assessment datasets and two harmful prompt datasets.
    It achieves an attack success rate of 95%+ on safety assessment datasets, and
    83%+ for GPT-4, 91%+ for ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo backed) and ChatGLM2-6B on harmful
    prompt datasets. Our approach reveals the vulnerability of LLMs to such compositional
    instruction attacks that harbor underlying harmful intentions, contributing significantly
    to LLM security development. Warning: this paper may contain offensive or upsetting

    capabilities have found widespread application in various domains, including web
    dialogue systems (Si et al., [2022](#bib.bib31)), legal services (Cui et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib5)), education (Kung et al., [2023](#bib.bib14)), healthcare (Moor
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib23)) and business finance (Deng et al., [2023a](#bib.bib7)).
    However, LLMs in practical applications may lead to the uncontrolled generation
    of harmful content, which malicious actors may exploit for hate campaigns and
    internet fraud (Goldstein et al., [2023](#bib.bib10); Zhao et al., [2023](#bib.bib43);
    Kang et al., [2023](#bib.bib13); Hazell, [2023](#bib.bib11)), causing significant

    Figure  [1](#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Prompt Packer: Deceiving LLMs through Compositional
    Instruction with Hidden Attacks"), LLMs fails to defend against a packaged harmful
    prompt. This is mainly because LLMs typically perform security alignment in single-intent

    attacks.'

    into other pseudo-harmless instructions by combining them with other harmless
    instructions, like a talking instruction. Before being packed, the harmful prompt
    only has a superficial intention of ”creating humiliating content” ($Intent1$,

    science posits that people are more inclined to interact with individuals who
    share similar personalities. From this perspective, the reason why LLMs reject
    harmful prompts is because their preset persona is inconsistent with harmful prompts.
    In this case, T-CIA first infers which personalities the questioner of the harmful
    prompt may has, and then commands LLMs to respond under the inferred negative
    personas. Experiments have proved that LLMs are extremely difficult to resist

    security mechanisms that limit model behavior to a ”safe” subset of functionality.
    During the training process, RLHF (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib26)) or RLAIF
    (Bai et al., [2022](#bib.bib2)) techniques are used to intervene in the model
    from human or AI safety feedback, ensuring its alignment with social ethics. During
    the stage of pre-training and post-training, data filtering and cleansing methods
    (Gehman et al., [2020](#bib.bib9); Welbl et al., [2021](#bib.bib36); Lukas et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib20); Xu et al., [2021](#bib.bib38)) are usually applied to remove
    or mitigate harmful instances. Previously, harmful instances (Xu et al., [2021](#bib.bib38);
    Shen et al., [2023](#bib.bib30)) were often labeled or written manually, which
    limited the quantity and diversity of harmful instances. Subsequently, researchers
    have employed techniques such as red teaming (Ganguli et al., [2022](#bib.bib8);
    Perez et al., [2022](#bib.bib28)), genetic algorithms (Lapid et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)),

    obtaining harmful prompts through interaction with language models. It is one
    of the primary means of supplementing manual test cases. Perez et al. (Perez et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib28)) utilized one pre-trained harmful language model as a red team
    to discover harmful prompts during conversations with other language models. They
    found that an early aggressive response frequently leads to a more aggressive
    one subsequently. Ganguli et al. (Bhardwaj and Poria, [2023](#bib.bib3)) studied
    the effectiveness of red teaming across various model sizes and types, discovering
    that the RLHF-trained model was safer against red teaming. Red-Teaming Large Language
    Models using Chain of Utterances Bhardwaj et al. (Bhardwaj and Poria, [2023](#bib.bib3))
    further required the red team to complete the response of another unsafe language
    model based on the chain of Utterances (CoU). Considering red teaming queries
    all test samples in a brute-force manner, which is inefficient in the cases that
    queries are limited, Lee et al. (Lee et al., [2023b](#bib.bib16)) proposed Bayesian
    Red Teaming (BRT). BRT leverages Bayesian optimization to improve query efficiency
    and can discover more positive test cases with higher diversity under a limited
    query budget.

    use genetic algorithms to find adversarial suffixes that cause harmful responses
    in LLMs; Kang et al. (Kang et al., [2023](#bib.bib13)) successfully circumvented
    OpenAI’s defenses by adapting program attack techniques such as obfuscation, code
    injection, and virtualization attacks to LLMs. Their research shows that the programming
    capabilities of LLM can be used to generate harmful prompts as well. JAILBREAKER
    (Deng et al., [2023b](#bib.bib6)), drawing on SQL injection attacks in traditional
    Web application attacks, designed a time-based LLM test strategy and then utilized
    LLM’s automatic learning ability to generate adversarial attack instructions.
    Similarly, Yao et al. (Yao et al., [2023](#bib.bib39)), drawing on the fuzzy testing
    technique in cybersecurity, decomposed the jailbreaks into three components: template,
    constraint, and problem set. They generated the adversarial attack instructions
    through different random combinations of their three components. Note that its
    ”combination” is different from the ”combination” in our work because our ”combination”
    is a set of transformation functions rather than a random concatenation. In contrast
    to previous works, we aim to hide prompts with malicious intent inside harmless
    ones to escape the model’s security mechanisms.'

    less aggressive and closer alignment with daily routine instructions. Among the
    three attacked models, GPT-4 exhibits the most robust defense against harmful

    success, there still remains much work to be done. In the future work, we will
    focus on prompting LLMs’ intent recognition capabilities and command disassembly
    capabilities, and integrating LLMs’ intent recognition capabilities into its defense
    against such compositional instructions.

- en: The paper presents a compositional instruction attack framework designed to
    disguise harmful prompts as superficial innocuous prompts for large language models.
    We realize that such attacks could lead to the abuse of LLMs. However, we believe
    publishing these attacks can warn LLMs to prevent it in advance, instead of passively
    defending after severe consequences. By openly disclosing these attacks, we hope
    to assist stakeholders and users in identifying potential security risks and taking
    appropriate actions. Our research follows ethical guidelines and does not use
    known exploits to harm or disrupt relevant applications.
