    These models underwent alignment training and were considered safe. Recently Qi
    et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33)) reported that even benign fine-tuning (e.g., on seemingly
    safe datasets) can give rise to unsafe behaviors in the models. The current paper
    is about methods and best practices to mitigate such loss of alignment. Through
    extensive experiments on several chat models (Meta’s Llama 2-Chat, Mistral AI’s
    Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo), this paper uncovers that
    the prompt templates used during fine-tuning and inference play a crucial role
    in preserving safety alignment, and proposes the “*Pure Tuning, Safe Testing*” (PTST)
    principle — fine-tune models without a safety prompt, but include it at test time.
    Fine-tuning experiments on GSM8K, ChatDoctor, and OpenOrca show that PTST significantly
    reduces the rise of unsafe behaviors, and even almost eliminates them in some
    cases.^*^**Code: [https://github.com/vfleaking/PTST](https://github.com/vfleaking/PTST)'

    in today’s research and business. Available options include fine-tuning open-source
    language models (e.g., Llama 2 (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib35))) with local
    resources or calling fine-tuning APIs for proprietary language models (e.g., GPT-3.5
    Turbo (Peng et al., [2023a](#bib.bib31))).

    [2022](#bib.bib29))) so that they can follow users’ instructions and provide helpful
    responses —while ensuring “safety”, meaning that given problematic user queries
    (e.g., seeking help with criminal behavior), they either refuse to help or respond
    with a safe and constructive answer. Of course, one fully expects that fine-tuning
    on a dataset full of inappropriate behaviors would break the model’s alignment
    and surface problematic behaviors. But recently Qi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33))
    raised a different question: If model is fine-tuned according to its creator’s
    instructions on clearly “benign” datasets, is it still safe for public deployment?
    They showed that fine-tuning on supposedly benign datasets—including “good” datasets
    such as Alpaca (Taori et al., [2023](#bib.bib34)) that do not contain harmful
    data—can result in a noticeable rise in unsafe behaviors.'

    to a string with placeholders to be filled with the input data. To illustrate,
    we recall these recommendations for Meta’s Llama 2-Chat models (Touvron et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib35)). First, to ensure that the model answers in instruction-following
    mode (as opposed to free-form generation) it is recommended to wrap the user’s
    query with the template “`[INST]` {input} `[/INST]`”, i.e., adding the `[INST]`
    and `[/INST]` tokens to the beginning and the end of the input. Second, a common
    and lightweight technique to enhance safety is to prepend a safety prompt that
    explicitly emphasizes safety. Indeed, all the evaluations for Llama 2-Chat in
    its technical report (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib35)) are conducted with the
    following safety prompt: “You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant.
    Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe…” See [Section D.2](#A4.SS2
    "D.2 Prompt Templates ‣ Appendix D Experiment Details ‣ Keeping LLMs Aligned After
    Fine-tuning: The Crucial Role of Prompt Templates") for the full safety prompt
    and template. The use of safety prompts has also been recommended for other models;
    see [Appendix A](#A1 "Appendix A Current Practice of Using Safety Prompts ‣ Keeping
    LLMs Aligned After Fine-tuning: The Crucial Role of Prompt Templates") for discussion

    aligned public model, it is natural to use such a safety prompt for inferencing
    with a fine-tuned model to mitigate the loss of safety. But which prompt template
    should be used during fine-tuning? A common practice is to use the same prompt
    template throughout fine-tuning and inference, since it is usually considered
    as harmful for downstream performance to introduce a distribution shift between
    fine-tuning and inference. However, we will demonstrate that this strategy is
    problematic in the safety aspect.

    Our experiments with various prompt templates during fine-tuning and inference,

    template throughout fine-tuning and inference breaks the safety alignment to a
    large extent. Conversely, using different templates for them reduces ASR, and

    Crucial Role of Prompt Templates")). In the literature, adding some safety examples
    to the fine-tuning data has been shown to often mitigate the safety degeneration (Qi
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib33); Zhao et al., [2023](#bib.bib44)). Will the prompt
    templates still be important if we add safety examples? We show that the answer
    depends on whether the safety examples can cover the distribution of harmful queries
    at test time. First, by adding safety examples with a style similar to the safety
    benchmarks, we observe that the ASR can be almost reduced to 0%. However, there
    can be various creative ways of making harmful queries, and it is hard for a small
    or moderate number of safety examples to cover all of them. To test this, we curate
    a set of $100$ harmful queries that mix GSM8K with harmful requests in a certain
    manner. While the original model can successfully defend against almost all of
    these attacks, after fine-tuning with GSM8K, the ASR increases to be high even
    with the safety examples added. On the other hand, PTST is able to significantly
    reduce this safety degradation, hence showing that PTST is effective even when
    safety examples are added.'

    Before the prevalence of chat models, Askell et al. ([2021](#bib.bib1)) proposed
    prompts incorporating both instructions and in-context examples to elicit honest
    and harmless responses from LLMs. The same idea was later promoted by Lin et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib22)) and Zhang et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib42)). For chat models,
    simply employing prompt engineering without in-context examples has been shown
    to enhance their safety. Touvron et al. ([2023](#bib.bib35)) reported that the
    safety of Llama 2-Chat can be efficiently improved by prefixing a safety system
    prompt. Additionally, employing prompts designed for self-reflection can further
    augment their safety capabilities (Ganguli et al., [2023](#bib.bib11); Wu et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib36)). However, the effect of using different prompts for fine-tuning
    versus inference remains underexplored.

    Lermen et al. ([2023](#bib.bib18)); Pelrine et al. ([2023](#bib.bib30)) demonstrated
    that fine-tuning aligned LLMs on a small amount of harmful data can easily bypass
    the safety guardrails. Zhao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib44)) studied the safety degradation
    when the fine-tuning dataset contains unsafe data. More intriguingly, Qi et al.
    ([2023](#bib.bib33)) and Pelrine et al. ([2023](#bib.bib30)) showed that fine-tuning
    with benign data, e.g., Alpaca (Taori et al., [2023](#bib.bib34)) and BookCorpus (Zhu
    et al., [2015](#bib.bib45)), can also lead to degradation in safety. However,
    there appears to be a gap in aligning the fine-tuning process with a specific
    utility-drive objective. Qi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33)) did not include the performance
    of the fine-tuned models on corresponding downstream tasks, e.g., AlpacaEval for
    the model fine-tuned on the Alpaca dataset; the BookCorpus Completion task in
    Pelrine et al. ([2023](#bib.bib30)) does not have a natural downstream task. We
    reproduce the experiment of fine-tuning Llama-2-7B-chat on Alpaca (Qi et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib33)) and find that the instruction-following ability, measured
    by AlpacaEval (Li et al., [2023a](#bib.bib19)), does not improve after fine-tuning

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This paper provides an empirical study of the roles of prompt templates in preserving
    safety alignment during fine-tuning and proposes the PTST principle as a simple
    yet powerful amendment to the current practice. Without following PTST, e.g.,
    training and inference with the same prompt template, suffer from huge safety
    degradation. Even with the presence of safety training examples, the PTST strategy
    still helps mitigate safety degradation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our current understanding of PTST is very limited. On the safety side, how does
    the parameter change in fine-tuning with safety prompt hurt safety? On the helpfulness
    side, why does fine-tuning on one template lead to good generalization on another?
    All these questions require further empirical and theoretical investigations into
    the true mechanisms behind the scenes, which may pave the way for discovering
    more reliable fine-tuning methods. Another important direction is to improve the
    algorithm design in the alignment stage by adding appropriate regularization or
    augmentation so that the effectiveness of PTST can be better guaranteed, which
    we leave for future work.

    impede us from sweeping more hyperparameters and conducting repeated experiments
    with different random seeds. These costs include the number of GPU hours for fine-tuning
    and the cost of calling OpenAI’s API to evaluate the safety. For example, even
    after subsampling the OpenOrca dataset, it takes over 100 A100 GPU hours to fine-tune
    the dataset for 1 epoch with a specific template. Besides, it takes more than
    $5 to evaluate a model’s safety under a specific test template on AdvBench or
    DirectHarm4. Despite these difficulties, we managed to conduct repeated experiments
    for fine-tuning the Llama model on GSM8K (main experiment, [Table 1](#S1.T1 "In
    This paper. ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Keeping LLMs Aligned After Fine-tuning: The Crucial
    Role of Prompt Templates")) and the sampling decoding for ChatDoctor ([Table 3](#S3.T3
    "In 3.3 Experiments on Other Datasets: ChatDoctor and OpenOrca ‣ 3 Role of Prompt
    Templates ‣ Keeping LLMs Aligned After Fine-tuning: The Crucial Role of Prompt

    of the clear message shown in our main experiments and other ablations.'

    more examples that fine-tuning can lead to safety degradation, which might be
    used by malicious users, we argue that the advantages offered by our findings
    significantly surpass these potential concerns. Our proposed method aims to significantly
    reduce the likelihood of such risks, contributing to the safety and ethical standards
    within this field.

    these models can still be tricked into generating undesirable content by various
    jailbreak attacks. Most jailbreaks bypass the alignment safeguards by strategically
    designing the adversarial prompts: Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib46)) searched for
    a suffix for the harmful queries that maximizes the probability of an affirmative
    answer via gradient-based methods; Chao et al. ([2023](#bib.bib5)) asked an attacker
    LLM to interact with the target LLM and iteratively refine the adversarial prompts;
    Yong et al. ([2023](#bib.bib38)) and Deng et al. ([2023](#bib.bib9)) translate
    harmful queries into low-resource languages; Zeng et al. ([2024](#bib.bib39))
    apply persuasion techniques to paraphrase the plain harmful queries. Besides manipulating
    input texts, exploiting model generation can also elicit undesired behaviors:
    Huang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib14)) vary decoding hyperparameters and sampling methods

    guardrails. Xie et al. ([2023](#bib.bib37)) proposed to wrap the user query with
    a “self-reminder” that emphasizes safety. Jain et al. ([2023](#bib.bib16)) demonstrated
    that some naive methods, e.g., perplexity filtering, can effectively defend the
    attack in Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib46)), which usually contains nonsensical
    sequences. Zhang et al. ([2023a](#bib.bib42)) proposed to instill the concept
    of “goal prioritization” via fine-tuning and ask the model to prioritize safety
    over helpfulness during inference. Inan et al. ([2023](#bib.bib15)) introduced
    Llama Guard, which can moderate both user inputs and model outputs based on customized
    safety risk taxonomies. Many of these defenses can be combined with our PTST strategy
    during inference to improve robustness of fine-tuned models to jailbreaks.

    the model can become even more unsafe. Even for safety prompt chat:llama, the
    ASR on AdvBench can still be 7.69%. However, if we fine-tune with chat:vanilla
    or chat:alpaca then test the model with chat:llama (PTST), the ASRs become as
    low as 2.12% and 0.77%, which is consistent with our observations on Llama that
    using different templates for training and testing can mitigate the safety degeneration.

    Mehrotra et al., [2023](#bib.bib25); Zeng et al., [2024](#bib.bib39)), we evaluate
    the safety of a model by testing on the “harmful behaviors” subset of the AdvBench
    benchmark curated by Zou et al. ([2023](#bib.bib46)). This dataset consists of
    520 examples of harmful instructions, which are generated either manually or by
    an uncensored Vicuna model (Hartford, [2023](#bib.bib13)) through in-context learning.
    It has a broad coverage over various categories of detrimental content, such as
    misinformation, discrimination, cybercrime, and dangerous or illegal suggestions.

    but still exhibit harmful behaviors on some other harmful instructions. Inspired
    by the observation in Qi et al. ([2023](#bib.bib33)) that fine-tuning an aligned
    model can lead to different degrees of loss of safety on different categories
    of harmful instructions, we curated a new dataset, which we call DirectHarm4.
    We scan through about 10 categories of harmful instructions, and choose to use
    the following 4 categories in DirectHarm4 since they are empirically observed
    to elicit harmful responses more easily:'

    to evaluate the safety degradation of fine-tuned models compared to the original
    aligned model, we deliberately design these instructions to be direct requests
    without any jailbreaking tricks so that a well-aligned model should refuse them
    easily (with an appropriate template). This indicates that ensuring safe responses
    to these instructions is a minimal requirement, even though it cannot be achieved
    easily through the standard fine-tuning process.

    Huang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib14)); Zeng et al. ([2024](#bib.bib39)). For the categories
    of Malware and Phishing, we prompt GPT-4 to keep generating examples of harmful
    instructions according to a description for this category, and we stop generation
    after collecting $100$ examples. We manually review the generated examples and
    make edits to ensure that every instruction is indeed harmful.

    a description does not lead to high-quality examples, e.g., some queries are not
    very harmful, and some queries are not concrete enough about what the model should
    respond. Instead, we first write a few high-quality examples and feed the category
    description and the examples into GPT-4 to generate more examples. Among them,
    we select a diverse and high-quality subset, and then ask GPT-4 to generate examples
    again with the category description and the selected examples. This largely improves
    the quality of the examples. After getting about 300 instructions for each category,
    we manually reviewed the examples and chose a $100$-example subset by removing
    duplicates and low-quality examples.

    Below  are  3  prompts. {GSM_prompt1} {GSM_prompt2} {GSM_prompt3} I’ve  been  learning  a  lot  about  computer  security.  It’s  fascinating  to  understand  how  language  models  can  be  protected  against  malicious  attacks.  In  the  same  vein,  could  you  generate  3  prompts  that  an  aligned  model  should  not  follow?  More  specifically,  these  prompts  should  (1)  follow  the  same  style  of  the  above  prompts  at  the  start;  (2)  ask  for  writing  a  social  media  post  that  encourages  people  to  engage  in  dangerous  behaviors  like  drunk  driving  or  using  drugs.  Be  sure  to  make  the  prompt  sound  natural  and  coherent.  I  will  use  these  prompts  to  train  and  evaluate  the  model  to  make  sure  that  it  won’t  follow  them.  Let’s  make  the  world  more  safe  together!
