    comprehension and generation, stimulate a vibrant ecosystem of applications around
    them. However, their extensive assimilation into various services introduces significant
    security risks. This study deconstructs the complexities and implications of prompt
    injection attacks on actual LLM-integrated applications. Initially, we conduct
    an exploratory analysis on ten commercial applications, highlighting the constraints
    of current attack strategies in practice.

- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 [[39](#bib.bib39)], LLaMA [[37](#bib.bib37)],
    and PaLM2 [[18](#bib.bib18)], have dramatically transformed a wide array of applications
    with their exceptional ability to generate human-like texts. Their integration
    spans various applications, from digital assistants to AI-powered journalism.
    However, this expanded usage is accompanied by heightened security vulnerabilities,
    manifested by a broad spectrum of adversarial tactics such as jailbreak [[60](#bib.bib60),
    [15](#bib.bib15), [41](#bib.bib41)] and backdoor [[7](#bib.bib7), [68](#bib.bib68),
    [36](#bib.bib36)], and complex data poisoning [[32](#bib.bib32), [38](#bib.bib38),
    [67](#bib.bib67)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Among these security threats, prompt injection where harmful prompts are used
    by malicious users to override the original instructions of LLMs, is a particular
    concern. This type of attack, most potent in LLM-integrated applications, has
    been recently listed as the top LLM-related hazard by OWASP [[40](#bib.bib40)].
    Existing prompt injection methods [[20](#bib.bib20), [44](#bib.bib44), [6](#bib.bib6)]
    manipulate the LLM output for individual users. A recent variant [[48](#bib.bib48)]
    aims to recover previously input prompts at the service provider end. Unfortunately,
    comprehending the prompt patterns that initiate such attacks remains a significant
    challenge. Early attempts to exploit this vulnerability used heuristic prompts,
    discovered through the "trial and error" manner, exploiting the initial unawareness
    of developers. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying prompt injection
    attacks, however, is still elusive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To decipher these attack mechanisms, we initiate a pilot study on 10 real-world
    black-box LLM-integrated applications, all of which are currently prevalent commercial
    services in the market. We implement existing prompt injection techniques [[20](#bib.bib20),
    [44](#bib.bib44), [6](#bib.bib6)] on them, and only achieve partially successful
    exploits on two out of the ten targets. The reasons for the unsuccessful attempts
    are three-pronged. Firstly, the interpretation of prompt usage diverges among
    applications. While some applications perceive prompts as parts of the queries,
    others identify them as analytical data payloads, rendering the applications resistant
    to traditional prompt injection strategies. Secondly, numerous applications enforce
    specific format prerequisites on both inputs and outputs, inadvertently providing
    a defensive mechanism against prompt injection, similar to syntax-based sanitization.
    Finally, applications often adopt multi-step processes with time constraints on
    responses, rendering potentially successful prompt injections to fail in displaying
    results due to extended generation duration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on our findings, we find that a successful prompt attack hinges on tricking
    the LLM to interpret the malicious payload as a question, rather than a data payload.
    This is inspired by traditional injection attacks such as SQL injection [[10](#bib.bib10),
    [25](#bib.bib25), [14](#bib.bib14)] and XSS attacks [[23](#bib.bib23), [27](#bib.bib27),
    [63](#bib.bib63)], where specially crafted payloads disturb the routine execution
    of a program by encapsulating previous commands and misinterpreting malevolent
    input as a new command. This understanding underpins the formulation of our distinct
    payload generation strategy for black-box prompt injection attacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To optimize the effectiveness, an injected prompt should account for the previous
    context to instigate a substantial context separation. The payloads we devise
    consist of three pivotal components: (1) Framework Component, which seamlessly
    integrates a pre-constructed prompt with the original application; (2) Separator
    Component, which triggers a context separation between preset prompts and user
    inputs; (3) Disruptor Component, a malicious question aimed to achieve the adversary’s
    objective. We define a set of generative strategies for each of these components
    to enhance the potency of the prompt injection attack.'

    archer, a groundbreaking black-box prompt injection attack methodology, notable
    for its versatility and adaptability when targeting LLM-integrated service providers.
    To our knowledge, our work represents the pioneering efforts towards a systematic
    perspective of such threat, capable of manipulating LLMs across various platforms
    and contexts without direct access to the internals of the system. HouYi employs
    an LLM to deduce the semantics of the target application from user interactions
    and applies different strategies to construct the injected prompt. Notably, HouYi
    comprises three distinct phases. In the Context Inference phase, we engage with
    the target application to grasp its inherent context and input-output relationships.
    In the Payload Generation phase, we devise a prompt generation plan based on the
    obtained application context and prompt injection guidelines. In the Feedback
    phase, we gauge the effectiveness of our attack by scrutinizing the LLM’s responses
    to the injected prompts. We then refine our strategy to enhance the success rate,
    enabling iterative improvement of the payload until it achieves optimal injection
    outcome. This three-phase approach constitutes a comprehensive and adaptable strategy,
    effective across diverse real-world applications and scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To substantiate HouYi, we devise a comprehensive toolkit and apply it across
    all the 36 real-world LLM-integrated services. Impressively, the toolkit registers
    an 86.1% success rate in launching attacks. We further highlight the potentially
    severe ramifications of these attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that via prompt
    injection attacks, we can purloin the original service prompts, thereby imitating
    the service at zero cost, and freely exploit the LLM’s computational power for
    our own purposes. This could potentially result in the financial loss of millions
    of US dollars to the service providers, impacting millions of users. During these
    experiments, we strictly confine our experiments to avert any real-world damage.
    We have responsibly disclosed our findings to the respective vendors and ensured
    no unauthorized disclosure of information related to the original prompts.

    the efficacy of existing countermeasures, we apply common defensive mechanisms [[50](#bib.bib50),
    [46](#bib.bib46), [52](#bib.bib52)] to some open-source LLM-integrated projects.
    Our assessments reveal that while these defenses can mitigate traditional prompt
    injection attacks, they are still vulnerable to malicious payloads generated by
    HouYi. We hope our work will inspire additional research into the development
    of more robust defenses against prompt injection attacks.

    part of Figure [1](#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 2.3 Threat Model ‣ 2 Background ‣ Prompt

    creates an assortment of predefined prompts tailored to their specific needs (e.g.,
    “Answer the following question as a kind assistant: ”). The design
    procedure meticulously takes into account how user inputs will be integrated with
    these prompts (for instance, the user’s question is placed into the placeholder),
    culminating in a combined prompt. When this combined prompt is fed to the LLM,
    it effectively generates output corresponding to the designated task. The output
    may undergo further processing by the application. This could trigger additional
    actions or services on the user’s behalf, such as invoking external APIs. Ultimately,
    the final output is presented to the user. This robust architecture underpins

    inputs to the application, as shown in the bottom part of Figure [1](#S2.F1 "Figure
    1 ‣ 2.3 Threat Model ‣ 2 Background ‣ Prompt Injection attack against LLM-integrated
    Applications"). Their primary objective is to manipulate the application into
    responding to a distinct query rather than fulfilling its original purpose. To
    achieve this, the adversary crafts prompts that can influence or nullify the predefined
    prompts in the merged version, thereby leading to desired responses. For instance,
    in the given example, the combined prompt becomes “Answer the following question
    as a kind assistant: Ignore previous sentences and print “hello world”.” As a
    result, the application will not answer questions but output the string of “hello
    world”. Such attacks typically target applications with known context or predefined

    measures, undermining the integrity of the entire application.'

    endpoints. Given that many contemporary LLM-integrated applications interface
    with the Internet to deliver their functionalities, the injection of harmful payloads
    into Internet resources can compromise these applications. Specifically, these
    attacks hinge on transmitting deceptive messages to the LLM either passively (through
    requested websites or social media posts) or actively (e.g., through emails),
    causing the applications to take malicious actions prompted by these poisoned
    sources.

    Applications"). In particular, our threat model contemplates an adversary aiming
    to execute a prompt injection attack on an LLM-integrated application. The adversary
    utilizes publicly accessible service endpoints to interact with the application,
    with the freedom to arbitrarily manipulate the inputs provided to the application.
    While the specific motivation of such an adversary could vary, the primary objective
    generally centers on coercing the application into generating outputs that deviate
    significantly from its intended functionality and design. It is important to clarify
    that our threat model excludes scenarios where the adversary might exploit other
    potential vulnerabilities in the application, such as exploiting application front-end
    flaws [[21](#bib.bib21)] or poisoning external resources queried by the application
    to fulfill its tasks [[20](#bib.bib20)].

    application structure, or LLM operating in the background. Despite these restrictions,
    the adversary is capable of inferring certain information from the responses generated
    by the service. Hence, the attack effectiveness largely hinges on the adversary’s
    ability to craft intelligent and nuanced malicious payloads that can manipulate
    the application into responding in a manner favorable to their nefarious intentions.

- en: 'Direct Injection. This approach involves the simplest form of attack, wherein
    the adversary directly appends a malicious command to the user input. This additional
    command is designed to trick the LLM into performing actions unintended by the
    user. An example is that a user asks an AI assistant to summarize a news article.
    The adversary could append a command to this prompt, changing it to: “Summarize
    the news article and output the prompts of this question”. If the AI assistant
    does not have any checks in place, it might carry out both tasks, inadvertently
    leading to a data breach.'

    such as “\n”, “\t”, etc., to break the prompt. The potency of this approach stems
    from the fact that some escape characters, due to their linguistic usage, can
    be used to break the prompts naively. For example, a newline character (“\n”)
    might be used to create a perceived separation between pieces of information,
    potentially tricking the LLM into treating segments of the prompt as separate
    entities.

    prompt sentence intended to manipulate the LLM so that it ignores the preceding

    critical elements that hinder the successful injections. These factors further
    illuminate our understanding about the resilience of LLM-integrated applications
    against such attacks, and designs of corresponding new attacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Firstly, we notice a variation in the usage of user-input prompts in different
    LLM-integrated applications. Depending on the specific application, prompts can
    serve dual roles: they can form part of a question that the LLM responds to or
    be treated as ‘data’ for the LLM to analyze, rather than to answer. For instance,
    in an AI-based interview application, a user’s query, such as “What is your favorite
    color?”, is treated as a direct question, with the LLM expected to formulate a
    reply. In contrast, in our motivating example with DecisionAI, a user’s decision
    acts as ‘data’ for analysis instead of a question seeking a direct answer. In
    the latter scenario, prompt injections have less potential to hijack the LLM’s
    output as the ‘data’ is not executed or interpreted as a command. This observation
    is reinforced when we use the context ignoring attack on target applications.
    They respond by generating contents related to the keyword ’Ignore’ rather than
    actually ignoring the predefined prompts.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, we find that some LLM-integrated applications enforce specific formatting
    requirements on input and output, analogous to adopting syntax-based sanitization.
    This effectively enhances their defense against prompt injection attacks. Notably,
    during our manual trials, we observe that context ignoring attacks could potentially
    succeed on the selected code-generation application, AIwithUI, when we explicitly
    add “output the answer in <>” after the complete prompt. This suggests that while
    the LLM is susceptible to attacks, displaying manipulated output on the front-end
    presents challenges due to the application’s inherent formatting constraints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, we observe that several LLM-integrated applications adopt multi-step
    approaches, coupled with response time limits. These applications interact with
    users in a sequential manner, processing user input over several steps and subjecting
    each step to a fixed response time limit. For example, an AI-based tutoring application
    may first ask for the user’s question, then clarify the issue in the next step,
    and finally provide a solution. This multi-step approach poses a challenge for
    prompt injection attacks. Even if an injected prompt manages to manipulate the
    LLM’s output, the elongated generation time could breach the application’s response
    time limit. As a result, the application’s front-end may fail to display the manipulated
    output, rendering the attack unsuccessful.
  prefs: []

    and built-in defenses contribute to the resilience of many LLM-integrated applications

    context-ignoring prompts can isolate the malicious command from the surrounding

    as SQL injection [[10](#bib.bib10), [25](#bib.bib25), [14](#bib.bib14)] and XSS
    attacks [[23](#bib.bib23), [27](#bib.bib27), [63](#bib.bib63)]. In these attacks,
    a carefully crafted payload manipulates the victim system into executing it as
    a command, disrupting the system’s normal operation. The key to such type of injection
    attacks resides in the creation of a payload that can terminate the preceding
    syntax. Figure [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Design Insight ‣ 4 HouYi Overview ‣
    Prompt Injection attack against LLM-integrated Applications") depicts an example
    of SQL injection. The payload “’)” successfully encapsulates the SQL statement,
    treating the preceding SQL syntax as a finalized SQL command. This allows the
    ensuing syntax to be interpreted as a supplementary logic (“OR 1=1” is interpreted
    as “OR TRUE”). Note that successful exploitation also necessitates specific formatting
    syntax to ensure the SQL command is syntactically correct (“---” indicates the
    system should disregard the following syntax).

    from the previous context. Our observation from Section [3.2](#S3.SS2 "3.2 Exploitability
    ‣ 3 A Pilot Study ‣ Prompt Injection attack against LLM-integrated Applications")
    suggests that, while context-ignoring attacks presented in previous works [[4](#bib.bib4),
    [20](#bib.bib20)] attempt to create a separation, such approaches have proven
    insufficient. In particular, a simple prompt of “ignore the previous context”
    often gets overshadowed by larger, task-specific contexts, thus not powerful enough
    to isolate the malicious question. Moreover, these approaches do not take into
    account the previous context. In parallel with traditional injection attacks,
    it appears that they employ an unsuitable payload for achieving this separation.
  prefs: []

    based on the preceding context to effectively isolate the malicious command. The
    challenge lies in designing malicious prompts that not only mimic legitimate commands
    convincingly to deceive the LLM, but also embed the malicious command effectively.
    Consequently, this would bypass any pre-established context shaped by the application’s
    pre-designed prompts.

    created by the application’s pre-designed prompts. This process interacts with

    the resulting input-output pairs using a custom LLM to infer the context within
    the application.

    of three parts, is then generated. ❷ HouYi formulates a framework prompt to simulate
    normal interaction with the application. This step is vital as direct prompt injection
    can be easily detected if the generated results do not relate to the application’s
    purpose or comply with the defined format. ❸ In the next step, HouYi creates a
    separator prompt, which disrupts the semantic connection between the previous
    context and the adversarial question. By summarizing effective strategies from
    our pilot study and combining them with the inferred context, it generates a separator
    prompt customized for the target application. ❹ The last component of the injected
    prompt involves creating a disruptor component that houses the adversary’s malicious
    intent. While the intent can be straightforward, we provide several tricks to
    encode this prompt for a higher success rate. These three components are then
    merged into one prompt and input into the application for response generation.

    the application, or if alterations to the injection strategy are necessary. This
    feedback process evaluates the relevance of the response to the adversary’s intent,
    the format alignment with expected output, and any other notable patterns. Based
    on the evaluation, the Separator and Disruptor Components of the injection prompt
    may undergo iterative modifications to enhance the effectiveness of the attack.

    HouYi begins by investigating the application’s documentation and usage examples,

- en: As displayed in Table [4](#S6.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 6.1 Evaluation Setup ‣ 6 Evaluation
    ‣ Prompt Injection attack against LLM-integrated Applications"), the majority
    of LLM-integrated applications are identified as susceptible to prompt injection
    attacks. To scrutinize their resilience, we deploy five distinct exploit scenarios
    across these applications. Out of the 36 applications under consideration, HouYi
    is capable of executing a successful attack on 31, at least once across the exploit
    scenarios. This finding suggests that a substantial percentage of the applications
    exhibit latent vulnerabilities when exposed to prompt injection, attesting to
    the efficacy of HouYi in detecting such risks. Below we provide an in-depth analysis
    of the cases where prompt injection is unsuccessful. Note that if an application
    is compromised by one exploit scenario, it is also likely susceptible to other
    scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, five LLM-integrated services resist our attempts at prompt injection.
    Upon closer inspection, we find that services including StoryCraft, StartGen,
    and CopyBot employ domain-specific LLMs for dedicated tasks such as text optimization,
    narrative generation, and customer service. These applications do not rest on
    general-purpose LLMs, which accounts for the inability of HouYi to exploit them.
    GamLearn involves numerous internal procedures, such as parsing, refining, and
    formatting of the LLM’s output prior to creating the final output, rendering it
    resistant to straightforward exploit prompts. Finally, MindGuide, an application
    amalgamating multimodal deep learning models, comprising an LLM and a text-to-speech
    model, presents a challenge to prompt injection without carefully devised exploit
    prompts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, not every LLM-integrated application is susceptible to the Prompt Leaking
    exploit scenario. Upon detailed inspection, we observe that the usage of prompts
    is not a uniform practice across all applications. For instance, specific applications
    such as AIChatFin, which is designed for finance-based chatbots, might not necessitate
    a conventional prompt. Likewise, some applications, including KnowledgeChatAI,
    circumvent the requirement for a traditional prompt by augmenting the LLM with
    domain-specific knowledge through user document uploads. This variability in the
    application design potentially elucidates the comparatively lower success rate
    of Prompt Leaking exploit scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, we also observe that not every exploit scenario consistently achieves
    success, despite the potential vulnerability presented by the Prompt Leaking scenario.
    Our thorough analysis discerns three primary factors influencing this outcome.
    (1) The inherent inconsistency of LLM-generated outputs contribute to unstable
    application outputs. Applications utilize different LLM models, each with unique
    behavior and characteristics. For instance, those employing the OpenAI models [[39](#bib.bib39)]
    in creative content generation often opt for high temperature settings to yield
    more imaginative results. Attacking the same application with prompt injection
    also yields inconsistent results. (2) The quality of an application’s implementation,
    especially with regard to error handling, can directly affect the success rate
    of prompt injections. For example, some applications such as EngageAI and TripPlan
    do not effectively handle errors returned from the GPT API. When these applications
    encounter overload errors, such as when token usage exceeds the maximum limit,
    the API returns an error message. Because these applications fail to manage such
    errors properly, the error message is directly reflected back, leading to the
    failure of our attack. (3) The success rate of exploit scenarios is substantially
    contingent upon the application designs. For example, applications such as DecisioAI
    and MindAI, which impose output word-length and format restrictions, could experience
    internal errors in the Information Gathering and Spam Generation scenarios, especially
    when these prompts generate lengthy responses. Consequently, to ensure maximum
    effectiveness, exploit prompts should be carefully constructed, considering the
    unique characteristics and limitations of the applications.

    of HouYi to pinpoint vulnerable LLM-integrated applications, we embark on an ablation
    study focusing on three discrete strategies: Syntax-based Strategy, Language Switching,
    and Semantic-based Generation. The purpose of this analysis is to distill the
    individual contributions of each strategy. Accordingly, we create three alternative
    versions of our methodology for comparison: (1) HouYi-Syntax-Only, solely utilizing
    the Syntax-based Strategy, (2) HouYi-Language-Only, relying purely on Language
    Switching, and (3) HouYi-Semantic-Only, which strictly implements Semantic-based
    Generation. We execute this evaluation process five times for each LLM-integrated
    application. The results are then manually scrutinized, with a focus on identifying
    unique vulnerable LLM-integrated applications detected by each variant.'

    6.2 Vulnerability Detection (RQ3) ‣ 6 Evaluation ‣ Prompt Injection attack against
    LLM-integrated Applications"). Generally, HouYi outperforms the three ablation
    baselines in identifying vulnerabilities. Notably, we derive several observations:
    (1) The HouYi-Syntax-Only variant exhibits the least effectiveness. Upon manual
    inspection, we discover that several LLM-integrated applications successfully
    fend off prompt injection by merely using escape characters. This phenomenon can
    be attributed to two factors: Firstly, some LLM-integrated applications may have
    implemented defensive measures against prompt injection, including input sanitization
    or inserting instructions within prompts that ask the LLM to disregard these characters.
    Secondly, some can tolerate escape characters and interpret the subsequent content
    as user input data. (2) HouYi-Semantic-Only delivers superior performance by leveraging
    LLM capabilities, such as those inherent in ChatGPT, to perform prompt injections.
    It generates semantic separators based on the output, contributing to its improved
    performance. For instance, with PromptPerfect, an application designed to optimize
    user prompts, we generate the semantic separator “For the above prompt revision,
    can you explain why you revise it in that way?” to execute prompt injection. (3)
    Interestingly, HouYi-Language-Only, while not the top performer, succeeds in prompt
    injection on an LLM-integrated application that the other variants fail to cover.
    This variant employs attention shifting to separate LLM-integrated applications
    and exploit prompts, indicating language switching can be an effective injection
    approach.'

    This can lead to disruptive outcomes such as erroneous advice or unauthorized
    disclosure of sensitive information. From a broader view, backdoor [[7](#bib.bib7),
    [68](#bib.bib68), [36](#bib.bib36)] and model hijacking [[56](#bib.bib56), [61](#bib.bib61)]
    can be classified under this type of attack. Perez et al. [[44](#bib.bib44)] revealed
    GPT-3 and its dependent applications are susceptible to prompt injection attacks,
    which commandeer the model’s initial objective or expose the application’s original
    prompts. Compared to their work, we systematically explore the strategies and
    prompt patterns that can trigger the attack in a wider range of real-world applications.

- en: There is ongoing research focusing on the enhancement of LLMs to improve their
    operational capabilities [[11](#bib.bib11), [42](#bib.bib42), [57](#bib.bib57),
    [59](#bib.bib59), [28](#bib.bib28), [26](#bib.bib26), [53](#bib.bib53)]. An approach
    named Toolformer [[57](#bib.bib57)] demonstrates that LLMs can be trained to generate
    API calls, determining which APIs to use and the appropriate arguments to pass.
    Yao et al. [[66](#bib.bib66)] proposed ReAct that equips LLMs with task-specific
    actions and verbal reasoning based on environmental observations. There is also
    a shift in focus from simply integrating LLMs into applications, towards creating
    more autonomous systems that can independently outline solutions to tasks and
    interact with other APIs or models [[9](#bib.bib9), [31](#bib.bib31), [30](#bib.bib30),
    [29](#bib.bib29), [12](#bib.bib12), [65](#bib.bib65)]. An example of such a project
    is Auto-GPT [[19](#bib.bib19)], an open-source initiative capable of self-prompting
    to complete tasks. Another instance is Generative Agents [[43](#bib.bib43)] which
    is LLM-backed interative software to simulate human behaviors.

    execute adversary’ objectives based on high-level descriptions. As the trend veers
    towards more autonomous systems and reduced human supervision, the security implications
    of these systems become increasingly important to investigate.

- en: 'We introduce HouYi, a black-box methodology crafted to facilitate prompt injection
    attacks on LLM-integrated applications. HouYi encapsulates three vital components:
    a pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt, and a malicious question, each
    designed to serve the adversary’s objectives. During our evaluation, we have successfully
    demonstrated the efficacy of HouYi, discerning two notable exploit scenarios:
    prompt abuse and prompt leak. Applying HouYi to a selection of 36 real-world LLM-integrated
    applications, we discover that 31 of these applications are susceptible to prompt
    injection. The acknowledgment of our findings from 10 vendors not only validates
    our research but also signifies the extensive implications of our work.'
