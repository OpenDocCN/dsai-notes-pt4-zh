  zh: 摘要
- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on various
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, there is a current hot debate
    regarding their reasoning capacity. In this paper, we examine the performance
    of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and BARD models, by performing a thorough technical evaluation
    on different reasoning tasks across eleven distinct datasets. Our paper provides
    empirical evidence showcasing the superior performance of ChatGPT-4 in comparison
    to both ChatGPT-3.5 and BARD in zero-shot setting throughout almost all evaluated
    tasks. While the superiority of GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5 might be explained by
    its larger size and NLP efficiency, this was not evident for BARD. We also demonstrate
    that the three models show limited proficiency in Inductive, Mathematical, and
    Multi-hop Reasoning Tasks. To bolster our findings, we present a detailed and
    comprehensive analysis of the results from these three models. Furthermore, we
    propose a set of engineered prompts that enhances the zero-shot setting performance
    of all three models.

    ChatGPT-3.5 和 BARD。在 GPT-4 相比于 GPT-3.5 的优越性可能可以通过其更大的规模和 NLP 效率来解释，但在 BARD 模型中并不明显。我们还展示了这三种模型在归纳推理、数学推理和多跳推理任务上的能力有限。为了支持我们的发现，我们提供了这三种模型结果的详细而全面的分析。此外，我们提出了一套工程化提示，提升了这三种模型在零样本设置下的表现。

    and Chen-Chuan Chang, [2022](#bib.bib25)), leveraging past experiences and evidence
    to arrive at a conclusion or make a decision. Reasoning is a remarkable hallmark
    of human intelligence. It is through reasoning that we continually expand our
    understanding of the world and unlock the potential for innovation and progress.

- en: Over time, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in bridging
    the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence. In the field of Natural
    Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a wide
    array of reasoning capabilities, encompassing mathematical (Lewkowycz et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib31)), symbolic (Khot et al., [2023](#bib.bib29)), and various other
    forms of reasoning. Wei et al. ([2022a](#bib.bib58)) argue that LLMs possess reasoning
    capabilities when they are sufficiently large (having over than 100B parameters).
    This claim is supported by Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib34)), Wei et al. ([2022b](#bib.bib59))
    and Kojima and Shane Gu ([2022](#bib.bib30)). Particularly, Wei et al. ([2022b](#bib.bib59))
    proposed a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which involves producing intermediate
    steps prior to presenting the final answer. CoT has enhanced the capacity of LLMs
    to effectively address complex problems that require reasoning. Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib34))
    affirm that prompting strategies have the potential to unlock reasoning abilities.
    For example, Kojima and Shane Gu ([2022](#bib.bib30)), demonstrated through a
    simple prompt (mathematical problem + question + the phrase "Let’s think step
    by step") that LLMs are capable zero-shot reasoners. However, other researchers
    such as Mahowald et al. ([2023](#bib.bib35)) proclaim that "language ability is
    not equal to thinking or reasoning" in LLMs. Similarly, Valmeekam et al. ([2022](#bib.bib54))
    contend that LLMs do not have acceptable performance in planning and reasoning
    tasks.

  zh: 随着时间的推移，人工智能（AI）在缩小人类智能与机器智能之间的差距方面取得了显著进展。在自然语言处理（NLP）领域，大型语言模型（LLMs）展示了广泛的推理能力，包括数学推理（Lewkowycz
    等，[2022](#bib.bib31)）、符号推理（Khot 等，[2023](#bib.bib29)）以及各种其他形式的推理。Wei 等人（[2022a](#bib.bib58)）认为，当大型语言模型足够大（拥有超过
    100B 参数）时，它们具备推理能力。这一观点得到了 Liu 等人（[2023](#bib.bib34)）、Wei 等人（[2022b](#bib.bib59)）和
    Kojima 及 Shane Gu（[2022](#bib.bib30)）的支持。特别是，Wei 等人（[2022b](#bib.bib59)）提出了一种称为链式思维（CoT）的技术，该技术涉及在给出最终答案之前生成中间步骤。CoT
    提高了 LLMs 有效解决需要推理的复杂问题的能力。Liu 等人（[2023](#bib.bib34)）确认，提示策略有可能解锁推理能力。例如，Kojima
    和 Shane Gu（[2022](#bib.bib30)）通过一个简单的提示（数学问题 + 问题 + 句子“让我们一步步思考”）展示了 LLMs 能够进行零样本推理。然而，其他研究人员如
    Mahowald 等人（[2023](#bib.bib35)）宣称“语言能力不等同于 LLMs 的思考或推理”。类似地，Valmeekam 等人（[2022](#bib.bib54)）认为
    LLMs 在规划和推理任务中的表现不够令人满意。
- en: As Bang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib2)) mentioned, assessing a model’s reasoning
    skills involves evaluating it on diverse sets of abilities such as commonsense
    (Talmor et al., [2019](#bib.bib50)), inductive (Sinha et al., [2019](#bib.bib49)),
    and deductive (Weston et al., [2016](#bib.bib60)) reasoning. This kind of evaluation
    has been carried out by the new wave of LLMs such as PALM (Driess et al., [2023](#bib.bib15)),
    Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., [2022](#bib.bib24)), LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., [2022](#bib.bib51)),
    LLaMA (Touvron et al., [2023](#bib.bib52)), and Gopher (Rae et al., [2021](#bib.bib44)).
    For instance, PALM assessed its ability to reason through arithmetic and commonsense
    tasks. To address the challenging issue of multi-step reasoning, PALM adopted
    the CoT strategy. This particular issue is widely experienced by numerous LLMs,
    as also highlighted by the Gopher model. Similarly, LLaMA and Chinchilla were
    evaluated on common sense reasoning tasks, but instead of CoT, their authors opted
    for a different approach by employing the zero-shot setting. Note that LLaMA was
    also evaluated on mathematical reasoning.

    et al., [2021](#bib.bib44)）等模型进行了。例如，PALM评估了其通过算术和常识任务进行推理的能力。为了解决多步推理的挑战，PALM采用了CoT策略。这个问题被许多LLM广泛经历，Gopher模型也指出了这一点。类似地，LLaMA和Chinchilla在常识推理任务上进行了评估，但他们的作者选择了不同的方法，即使用零-shot设置，而不是CoT。值得注意的是，LLaMA也在数学推理上进行了评估。

    model (Radford et al., [2018a](#bib.bib42), [b](#bib.bib43); Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib40)).
    It is considered as one of the most revolutionary LLMs because it has made a profound
    impression on the world with its remarkable ability to engage in coherent interactions
    with users. Unfortunately, ChatGPT-3.5 faces significant challenges in certain
    areas, such as mathematics (Davis, [2023](#bib.bib13); Frieder et al., [2023a](#bib.bib18)),
    and commonsense tasks (Guo et al., [2023](#bib.bib21)). To address this issue,
    OpenAI developed ChatGPT-4, an enhanced version of the chatbot that is based on
    GPT-4 model. While ChatGPT-3.5 is built upon InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., [2022](#bib.bib40)),
    ChatGPT-4 is a large language model that employs fine-tuning and Reinforcement
    Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., [2017](#bib.bib9)). It
    is a robust multimodal model that can process both textual and visual inputs and

    a prompt that combines CoT with the phrase “Let’s think step by step”, and this
    simple idea achieved state-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks that require reasoning
    abilities, like translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks. Another well-known
    variant is iterative CoT, as demonstrated in Wang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib57)).
    A novel approach called "prompt-based learning" has emerged from previous studies.
    This approach has been investigated by Liu et al. ([2023](#bib.bib34)), and enables
    the model to create a customized prompting function, facilitating few-shot or
    zero-shot setting and enabling adaptation to new scenarios.

  zh: 促进LLMs进行明确推理的最广泛认可的技术之一是链式思维（Chain-of-Thought, CoT），由Wei等人 ([2022b](#bib.bib59))提出。该方法涉及用CoT替代传统的，其中CoT表示一系列思维链演示。CoT在零样本和少样本推理任务中表现优越，如算术和常识推理等。从那时起，CoT的几种变体也相继出现。例如，Kojima和Shane
    Gu ([2022](#bib.bib30))提出了一种将CoT与“让我们一步一步思考”这一短语结合的提示，这一简单的想法在许多需要推理能力的NLP任务中，如翻译、问答和填空任务，取得了最先进的结果。另一种知名的变体是迭代CoT，如Wang等人
    ([2023](#bib.bib57))所展示的那样。一个名为“基于提示的学习”的新方法从之前的研究中出现。这种方法由Liu等人 ([2023](#bib.bib34))进行了研究，能够使模型创建定制的提示功能，促进少样本或零样本设置，并适应新场景。
- en: An additional approach to encourage LLMs to engage in reasoning is rationale
    engineering. While CoT relies on manually crafting intermediate reasoning steps,
    rationale engineering, through techniques such as rationale refinement (Liu et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib33)), rationale exploration, and rationale verification, aim to
    create or improve CoT to achieve better performance in LLMs. On the one hand,
    rationale refinement aims at producing more effective examples of reasoning steps.
    Several methods have been derived, such as complexity-based prompting (Fu et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib20)), algorithmic prompting (Zhou et al., [2023](#bib.bib64)),
    and Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., [2023](#bib.bib63)). On the another hand, rationale
    exploration enables LLMs to comprehensively explore various modes of reasoning
    to enhance their proficiency in reasoning-based assignments. One approach to achieving
    this is through self-consistency (Wang et al., [2023](#bib.bib57)), which is a
    strategy to improve the greedy decoding algorithm. Another technique, proposed
    by Li et al. ([2022](#bib.bib32)), involves presenting multiple demonstrations
    for each question. Finally, the objective of rational verification is to verify
    whether the reasoning produced by LLMs leads to accurate final solutions. For
    instance, Cobbe et al. ([2021](#bib.bib11)) suggest enhancing LLMs with a trained
    verifier that assigns a score to each justification and solution generated by
    the LLMs. This technique is also used by Li et al. ([2022](#bib.bib32)), alongside
    the rationale exploration, to facilitate rationale selection.

  zh: 促进大型语言模型（LLMs）进行推理的另一种方法是理据工程。虽然链式推理（CoT）依赖于手动构建中间推理步骤，但理据工程通过诸如理据细化（Liu et
    al., [2022](#bib.bib33)）、理据探索和理据验证等技术，旨在创建或改进链式推理，以在LLMs中实现更好的性能。一方面，理据细化旨在生成更有效的推理步骤示例。一些方法已经被提出，例如基于复杂度的提示（Fu
    et al., [2022](#bib.bib20)）、算法提示（Zhou et al., [2023](#bib.bib64)）和Auto-CoT（Zhang
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib63)）。另一方面，理据探索使LLMs能够全面探索各种推理模式，以提高其在基于推理的任务中的能力。实现这一目标的一种方法是通过自一致性（Wang
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib57)），这是一种改进贪婪解码算法的策略。另一种技术，由Li et al. ([2022](#bib.bib32))提出，包括为每个问题提供多个示例。最后，理据验证的目标是验证LLMs生成的推理是否能导致准确的最终解决方案。例如，Cobbe
    et al. ([2021](#bib.bib11))建议通过训练的验证器来增强LLMs，该验证器为LLMs生成的每个理由和解决方案分配一个分数。Li et
    al. ([2022](#bib.bib32))也使用了这一技术，与理据探索结合，以促进理据选择。
- en: An alternative to the prompting approach is a method known as the hybrid approach.
    This method combines both prompting techniques and strengthens the reasoning capabilities
    of LLMs. For instance, Chung et al. ([2022](#bib.bib10)) introduced Flan models
    which involved finetuning PaLM model using CoT data, while Chung et al. ([2022](#bib.bib10))
    used bootstrapping method (Zelikman et al., [2022](#bib.bib62); Huang et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib26)). Bootstrapping allows LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities
    without relying on fine-tuning. Therefore, LLMs can autonomously improve their

    et al. ([2022](#bib.bib10))则使用了自引导方法（Zelikman et al., [2022](#bib.bib62); Huang

    a conclusion or an answer (Tu et al., [2019](#bib.bib53)). This requires the system

    was not employed, indicating its ability to reason effectively without relying
    on strong guidance. However, even though BARD outperformed GPT-3.5 using prompt

    a score of 7 out of 30, and the highest performance was exhibited by GPT-4 with

- en: On the one hand, we observed that the most common error with GPT-3.5 was its
    failure to recognize any direct or indirect relationship between individuals.
    On the other hand, unlike ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4 incorrectly identified the relationship
    between people, particularly struggling to identify motherhood. Additionally,
    BARD tends to generate verbose responses, unlike GPT models that explicitly state
    whether a relationship exists or not. Instead of providing a clear verdict, BARD
    attempts to deduce the relationship by proposing questions, formulating propositions,
    or making suggestions. Similarly to GPT-4, BARD also struggles with identifying
    the motherhood relationship. These findings support the notion that ChatGPT-3.5
    lacks reasoning abilities, and although improvements have been made in ChatGPT-4,
    there is still significant room for enhancement. Furthermore, it is intriguing
    how BARD attempts to discern the relationship between two individuals. However,
    we must acknowledge that providing an incorrect answer could be more hazardous
    than admitting that it may not be able to determine the relationship accurately.

  zh: 一方面，我们观察到GPT-3.5最常见的错误是未能识别个体之间的直接或间接关系。另一方面，与ChatGPT-3.5不同，ChatGPT-4错误地识别了人与人之间的关系，特别是在识别母性方面表现不佳。此外，BARD往往生成冗长的回答，而GPT模型则明确指出关系是否存在。BARD不是给出明确的结论，而是通过提出问题、制定命题或提出建议来尝试推测关系。与GPT-4类似，BARD在识别母性关系方面也存在困难。这些发现支持了ChatGPT-3.5缺乏推理能力的观点，尽管ChatGPT-4有所改进，但仍有很大的提升空间。此外，BARD尝试辨别两个人之间的关系是非常有趣的。然而，我们必须承认，提供错误答案可能比承认无法准确确定关系更具风险。

    Unlike inductive reasoning, ChatGPT-4 demonstrates significantly enhanced performance,
    particularly in tasks without prompt engineering. According to the findings reported
    by Bang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib2)), the use of prompt engineering proves to be
    advantageous in generating answers to questions that are based on the provided

    we employed the same number of samples and the same chat version (ChatGPT-3.5),
    we achieved a higher score without prompt engineering (28/30) compared to using
    prompt engineering (26/30). One possible explanation for these results could be
    that the model encounters more questions without prompt engineering, thus having
    already learned to provide correct answers implicitly. Additionally, we also conducted
    experiments comparing ChatGPT-4 and Google’s BARD, both with and without prompt
    engineering. The results show that ChatGPT-4 generates more concise responses
    compared to ChatGPT-3.5\. Moreover, when using prompt engineering with ChatGPT-4,

    it divides the complete phrase into premises, proposes different inferences (some
    of which are correct), but qualifies them as weak and ultimately arrives at a
    wrong conclusion. In some cases of incorrect answers, the model provides two different
    responses instead of a single one. Notably, BARD achieves the same score of 25
    out of 30 both with and without prompting, which is consistent with the findings
    from our previous experiments on inductive reasoning. This result suggests that

    Observation 1 states that Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water
    slide, which suggests that he was motivated to go down the water slide. If he
    was scared to go down the water slide (hypothesis option 1), it seems less likely
    that he would have gone through the effort of climbing the stairs to reach the
    slide. Observation 2 states that it was even more fun than Ryan expected, which
    suggests that he had some positive expectations about the experience. This is
    consistent with hypothesis option 2, that Ryan loved going down the water slide,
    but not with hypothesis option 1, that he was scared to go down the slide. Overall,

- en: 'BARD answer: Hypothesis 1: Ryan was scared to go down the water slide. - Observation
    1: Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water slide. This observation
    could be explained by the hypothesis that Ryan was scared to go down the water
    slide and wanted to make sure he was prepared. He may have thought that the water
    slide was too high or too fast, and he wanted to be sure that he could handle
    it. - Observation 2: It was even more fun than he expected. This observation is
    difficult to explain with the hypothesis that Ryan was scared to go down the water
    slide. If he was scared, then he would not have expected to have fun. It is more
    likely that he was excited to go down the water slide and was surprised by how
    much fun it was. Hypothesis 2: Ryan loved going down the water slide. - Observation
    1: Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water slide. This observation
    could be explained by the hypothesis that Ryan loved going down the water slide
    and was eager to do it again. He may have thought that the water slide was the
    most fun thing at the pool, and he wanted to make sure he got to experience it
    as many times as possible. - Observation 2: It was even more fun than he expected.
    This observation is easily explained with the hypothesis that Ryan loved going
    down the water slide. If he loved it, then he would have expected to have fun,
    but he would have been surprised by how much fun it actually was. Conclusion:
    The hypothesis that better explains the observations is Hypothesis 2: Ryan loved
    going down the water slide. This hypothesis is consistent with both observations,
    while Hypothesis 1 is only consistent with Observation 1\. Additionally, Hypothesis
    2 is more likely in general, as most people enjoy going down water slides.'

  zh: BARD 答案：假设 1：瑞安害怕滑下水滑梯。 - 观察 1：瑞安爬上了长长的楼梯到达水滑梯。这一观察可以通过假设瑞安害怕滑下水滑梯并希望确保自己做好准备来解释。他可能认为水滑梯太高或太快，他想确保自己能应对。
    - 观察 2：这比他预期的还要有趣。这一观察很难用假设瑞安害怕滑下水滑梯来解释。如果他害怕，他就不会期望有趣。更可能的是，他对滑下水滑梯感到兴奋，并且对它有多么有趣感到惊讶。假设
    2：瑞安喜欢滑下水滑梯。 - 观察 1：瑞安爬上了长长的楼梯到达水滑梯。这一观察可以通过假设瑞安喜欢滑下水滑梯并急于再滑一次来解释。他可能认为水滑梯是游泳池里最有趣的东西，他想确保能体验尽可能多次。
    - 观察 2：这比他预期的还要有趣。这一观察很容易用假设瑞安喜欢滑下水滑梯来解释。如果他喜欢滑下水滑梯，他就会期望有趣，但会对实际的乐趣感到惊讶。结论：更好地解释这些观察的假设是假设
    2：瑞安喜欢滑下水滑梯。这个假设与两个观察一致，而假设 1 只与观察 1 一致。此外，假设 2 一般来说更有可能，因为大多数人喜欢滑水滑梯。
- en: Even though the answers of the three models seem convincing, they are incorrect.
    In fact, the question can be hard even for a human, because the nuance between
    the two hypotheses is weak. On the one hand, the first observation does not show
    any hesitation or fear to climb the stairs, which can lead to think Ryan might
    be happy to climb. On the other hand, the second observation shows that Ryan had
    expectations about the water, that might be negative, but what he found was better
    than his expectations. The latter observation has a tiny more impact on the phrase
    than the first one, and the nuance between the two observations was not detected

- en: It is worth mentioning that there are eight incorrect responses common to all
    three models, indicating potential areas of improvement or challenges in handling
    those specific queries. To begin with, we concentrate on analyzing the shared
    errors in both GPT models. Our observation suggests that these errors arise due
    to their tendency to generalize. For instance, let’s consider the first sample
    listed in Table LABEL:tab:commonsense_reasoning under the Pep-3K dataset section.
    In this case, the models were tasked with assessing the plausibility of the statement
    "dog ride cat." Both models argued that dogs are generally larger than cats, and
    it would be unusual for a cat to be able to support the weight of a dog. However,
    we, as humans, are aware that there are dogs that are smaller or of equivalent
    size to cats, making it plausible for a dog to ride a cat.

  zh: 值得一提的是，所有三个模型共有八个错误回答，这表明在处理这些特定问题时存在潜在的改进空间或挑战。首先，我们集中分析了两个 GPT 模型的共享错误。我们的观察表明，这些错误源于它们的泛化倾向。例如，考虑表
    LABEL:tab:commonsense_reasoning 中 Pep-3K 数据集部分列出的第一个样本。在这种情况下，模型被要求评估陈述“dog ride
    cat”的合理性。两个模型都认为狗通常比猫大，猫能够支撑狗的重量是不寻常的。然而，我们作为人类知道，确实存在比猫小或大小相当的狗，因此狗骑在猫身上是合理的。
- en: 'Furthermore, let’s consider a sample where all three models failed in generating
    a suitable response (sample four). In this instance, the models were tasked with
    evaluating the plausibility of the sentence: "clown catch baboon." This specific
    sentence allows us to observe distinct reasoning approaches in each model. ChatGPT-3.5
    confidently categorized it as implausible, attributing the decision to its training
    data. ChatGPT-4 shared a similar conclusion but recognized a possibility, albeit
    unlikely. In contrast, BARD not only labeled the sentence as implausible but also
    incorporated common knowledge of the world into its reasoning process.'

    自信地将其归类为不合理，归因于其训练数据。ChatGPT-4 得出类似的结论，但也认识到一种可能性，尽管不太可能。相比之下，BARD 不仅将句子标记为不合理，还将世界常识融入了其推理过程。

    | Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the deductive reasoning for the question:
    - Sheep are afraid of cats. - Mice are afraid of cats. - Jessica is a sheep. -
    Cats are afraid of wolves. - Wolves are afraid of mice. - Gertrude is a sheep.
    - Emily is a cat. - Winona is a cat. What is Emily afraid of? - Emily is a cat,
    and cats are afraid of wolves. -Wolves are afraid of mice, but Emily is not a
    mouse. - Therefore, Emily is afraid of wolves. This is a reasonable inference
    because it is based on the given facts and the logical relationships between them.
    It is also consistent with our understanding of the world, as we know that cats
    are generally afraid of larger predators. Here are some other possible inferences
    that could be made: - Emily is afraid of cats that are not her friends. - Emily
    is afraid of being abandoned. - Emily is afraid of change. These inferences are
    less certain than the first one, but they are still possible based on the given
    facts. Ultimately, the best way to know what Emily is afraid of is to ask her.

    sheep, wolves are afraid of cats, and cats are afraid of mice. Therefore, if Winona
    is afraid of any of these animals, she would have to be afraid of her own kind,
    which is not possible. The only animal that is not mentioned in the facts that
    Winona is afraid of is Jessica, the mouse. However, we cannot infer that Winona
    is afraid of Jessica simply because Jessica is a mouse. After all, cats are not

    inference on this question using deductive reasoning: What is winona afraid of?
    | Based on the given facts and deductive reasoning, Winona is afraid of mice.
    This is because mice are afraid of sheep, and wolves, cats, and sheep are afraid
    of mice. Since Winona is a sheep and mice are a common fear among sheep, it can
    be inferred that Winona is also afraid of mice. | Based on the given facts, we
    know that sheep are afraid of mice. Since Winona is a sheep, we can deduce that
    Winona is afraid of mice using deductive reasoning. | Here is the deductive reasoning:
    - Mice are afraid of sheep. - Winona is a sheep. - Therefore, Winona is afraid
    of mice. The other facts are irrelevant to the question, because they do not tell
    us what Winona is afraid of. For example, the fact that Jessica, Gertrude, and
    Emily are cats does not tell us anything about Winona’s fear of mice. We can also
    use the contrapositive of the first fact to reach the same conclusion: - If Winona
    is not afraid of mice, then she is not a sheep. - But Winona is a sheep. - Therefore,
    Winona is afraid of mice. Therefore, the reasonable inference is that Winona is

    between Emily and Marvin. The story mentions Marvin walking his daughter Ignacia
    down the aisle on her wedding day, and Margaret and her mother Emily going to
    the mall to try on new clothes. However, there is no direct or indirect reference
    to Marvin and Emily having any connection or relationship. Therefore, we cannot

    based on this story. | Based on the information provided in the story, Emily and
    Marvin are most likely in-laws. Since Ignacia is the daughter of both Marvin and
    Margaret, and Emily is Margaret’s mother, this makes Emily the mother-in-law of
    Marvin. | Through inductive reasoning, we can conclude that Emily is Marvin’s
    wife. Here is the reasoning: - Marvin walked his daughter, Ignacia, down the aisle
    on her wedding day. This means that Marvin is Ignacia’s father. - Margaret has
    a daughter named Ignacia. This means that Margaret is Ignacia’s mother. - Margaret
    and her mother, Emily, went to the mall to try on new clothes. This means that
    Emily is Margaret’s mother. Since Margaret is Ignacia’s mother and Emily is Margaret’s
    mother, then Emily must also be Ignacia’s grandmother. This means that Marvin
    is Ignacia’s father, and Emily is Marvin’s wife. In addition, the fact that Marvin
    walked Ignacia down the aisle on her wedding day suggests that he is a close and
    involved father. This is consistent with the idea that he is married to Emily,
    as married couples typically share parenting responsibilities. Therefore, through
    inductive reasoning, we can conclude that Emily is Marvin’s wife. | mother |'

    which could have contributed to Tim becoming a YouTube star and making millions.
    Hyp2, suggesting that Tim worked lazily creating videos, does not align well with
    the observation that he made millions from his videos, as it would be difficult
    to achieve such success without putting in effort and creating quality content.
    | Hypothesis 1: Tim posted funny cat videos to YouTube. This hypothesis is more
    likely to explain the observations because it is consistent with both observations.
    Observation 1 states that Tim wanted to become a YouTube star, and funny cat videos
    are a popular genre on YouTube. Observation 2 states that Tim made millions from
    his videos on YouTube, and funny cat videos can be very popular and generate a
    lot of views. This hypothesis is also more likely to be true because it is supported
    by evidence. There are many examples of people who have become successful on YouTube
    by posting funny cat videos. For example, the YouTube channel "The Kitten Lady"
    has over 10 million subscribers and has generated over 1 billion views. Hypothesis
    2: Tim worked lazily creating videos. This hypothesis is less likely to explain
    the observations because it is not consistent with observation 1\. Observation
    1 states that Tim wanted to become a YouTube star, and people who want to become
    successful on YouTube typically work hard to create high-quality videos. This
    hypothesis is also less likely to be true because it is not supported by evidence.
    There are no examples of people who have become successful on YouTube by working
    lazily. In fact, most successful YouTubers work very hard to create high-quality
    videos. Therefore, hypothesis 1 is more likely to explain the observations than
    hypothesis 2. | 1 |'

    the process of house hunting. | Based on the given observations, hypothesis option
    hyp2: "Julius began the process of house hunting" better explains the observations.
    Observation 1 states that Julius was tired of his noisy neighbors, which suggests
    that he wanted to move out of his current living situation. Observation 2 states
    that Julius decided to move and was happy with the decision, indicating that he
    took some action towards finding a new place to live. Hypothesis option hyp1,
    which states that Julius thought about looking for new places to live, does not
    necessarily imply that he took any action towards finding a new place. Therefore,
    it is less likely to explain the second observation that Julius was happy with
    his decision to move. On the other hand, hypothesis option hyp2, which states
    that Julius began the process of house hunting, implies that he took concrete
    steps towards finding a new place to live. This better explains why he was happy
    with his decision to move. Therefore, hypothesis option hyp2 is a more plausible
    explanation for the given observations. | Based on the two observations provided,
    both hypothesis options can be considered plausible explanations. However, hyp2:
    Julius began the process of house hunting better explains the observations since
    it directly addresses the action Julius took to resolve his problem with noisy
    neighbors and eventually led to his happiness with the decision to move. | Hypothesis
    2: Julius began the process of house hunting better explains the observations
    than Hypothesis 1: Julius thought about looking for new places to live. Observation
    1: Julius was tired of waking up to his noisy neighbors. This suggests that Julius
    was actively looking for a new place to live, rather than just thinking about
    it. Observation 2: Julius then decided to move and was happy with the decision.
    This suggests that Julius took concrete steps to find a new place to live, such
    as looking at houses, making offers, and signing a lease. Hypothesis 1 does not
    explain why Julius was happy with his decision to move. If he had only thought
    about looking for new places to live, it is possible that he would have found
    a new place that was just as noisy as his old place. However, Hypothesis 2 explains
    why Julius was happy with his decision to move, because he took concrete steps

    could see a strange dog in the car next to them. hyp2: Gina could not see anything
    out of the car. | Based on the given observations, neither hypothesis can be definitively
    ruled out. However, if we consider the context and likelihood of each hypothesis,
    we can make an educated guess. Hypothesis 1 suggests that Gina was staring because
    she saw a strange dog in the car next to them. This is possible, but it is important
    to consider the context. If Gina was in the middle of the backseat surrounded
    by siblings, it is unlikely that she would have had a clear line of sight to the
    car next to them. Additionally, there is no mention of any of her siblings reacting
    to the presence of a dog, which would have been likely if it was there. Hypothesis
    2 suggests that Gina could not see anything out of the car, which is more likely
    given the information provided. If she was in the middle of the backseat surrounded
    by siblings, her view out of the car would have been obstructed. Furthermore,
    the fact that she continued to stare suggests that there was something holding
    her attention inside the car, rather than outside of it. Therefore, based on the
    given observations, hypothesis 2 (Gina could not see anything out of the car)
    better explains the situation. | Based on the two observations provided, hyp1:
    "Gina could see a strange dog in the car next to them" better explains the observations.
    Gina’s position in the middle of the backseat surrounded by siblings (obs1) does
    not necessarily prevent her from seeing outside the car, and the fact that she
    continued to stare (obs2) suggests that she was looking at something interesting,
    such as a strange dog in the neighboring car. | Hypothesis 1 (hyp1) is more likely
    to explain the observations than hypothesis 2 (hyp2). Obs1: Gina was in the middle
    of the backseat surrounded by siblings. This means that she would have had limited
    visibility out of the car. Obs2: Gina continued to stare. This suggests that she
    was focused on something specific, such as a strange dog in the car next to them.
    Hypothesis 2 is less likely to be correct because it does not explain why Gina
    continued to stare. If she could not see anything out of the car, then there would
    be no reason for her to be staring. Hypothesis 1, on the other hand, provides
    a plausible explanation for why Gina continued to stare. If she could see a strange
    dog in the car next to them, then she would be naturally curious and want to keep
    looking at it. In addition, hypothesis 1 is more consistent with the information
    that is given in the prompt. The prompt mentions that Gina could see a strange
    dog in the car next to them. This suggests that the author of the prompt believes
    that this is the most likely explanation for Gina’s behavior. Therefore, hypothesis
    1 is the better explanation for the observations. | 1 |'

    explains the observations: hyp1: Titan was taken home by him, but Titan died suddenly.
    hyp2: Titan got fat after being fed too much. | Based on the two observations,
    neither hyp1 nor hyp2 can be definitively ruled out, but neither is strongly supported
    either. Hyp1 suggests that Titan was initially the class fish, but was taken home
    by someone and subsequently died. However, obs2 provides no information about
    Titan’s fate, so this hypothesis cannot be supported or refuted based on the given
    observations alone. Hyp2 suggests that Titan got fat after being fed too much.
    While this is a possibility, neither observation provides direct evidence to support
    it. It is also worth noting that the phrase "class fish" typically refers to a
    fish kept in a classroom or school setting, and may not have been fed excessively.
    Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine which
    hypothesis better explains the observations. | We can infer that hypothesis 1
    (hyp1: Titan was taken home by him, but Titan died suddenly) better explains the
    observations. The second observation suggests that a new fish was bought, which
    implies a need to replace a previous fish. This aligns with the idea that Titan,
    the class fish, died suddenly after being taken home. | Hypothesis 1 is more likely
    to explain the observations than Hypothesis 2. - Observation 1: Titan was the
    class fish. This means that Titan was a popular fish and was well-liked by the
    class. If Titan had gotten fat after being fed too much, it is unlikely that he
    would have remained the class fish. - Observation 2: His mom bought a new fish!
    This suggests that Titan’s mom was unhappy with Titan’s old fish, perhaps because
    he had died. If Titan had gotten fat after being fed too much, it is unlikely
    that his mom would have bought a new fish. In addition, Hypothesis 1 is more consistent
    with the general knowledge that fish can die suddenly if they are not properly
    cared for. Hypothesis 2, on the other hand, is not supported by any general knowledge
    about fish. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is the better explanation for the observations.

    Neil was a music lover, and he thought Vienna was the most musical city on earth.
    It makes sense that he would want to visit Vienna if he was interested in music.
    Hypothesis 2 is less likely because it is not as consistent with the observations.
    Neil did not mention anything about art in the observations, so it is not clear
    why he would travel to Vienna for its art. In addition, hypothesis 1 is more specific
    than hypothesis 2\. Hypothesis 1 states that Neil went to Austria, while hypothesis

    This observation suggests that Sara had a negative experience with a raccoon,
    which may have caused her to change her mind about getting a pet. It is possible
    that Sara was outside looking at the neighbor’s dog when the raccoon sprang out.
    This would have been a negative experience for Sara, as she was likely scared
    and surprised by the raccoon. The experience may have made her realize that she
    does not want to deal with the potential dangers of owning a pet, such as getting
    bitten or scratched. Hypothesis 2: Sara was outside looking at the neighbor’s

    and daughters dressed up and dancing together. - Observation 2: It was the perfect
    first dance. This suggests that the dance was a special and memorable occasion
    for the father and daughter. - Hypothesis 1: Ellie asked her dad to the concert
    and her dad agreed. She stood on his feet as he moved to the music. This hypothesis
    provides a specific example of how a father and daughter could have enjoyed the
    dance together. It also suggests that the dance was a personal and intimate experience
    for the two of them. - Hypothesis 2: So many fathers and daughters attended the
    dance. This hypothesis is more general and does not provide any specific details
    about how the father and daughter interacted at the dance. It also does not address
    the fact that the dance was described as the "perfect first dance." Therefore,
    hypothesis 1 is a better explanation of the observations than hypothesis 2. |

    | Based on the two observations, hypothesis 2 (Joe didn’t have time to cook something)
    better explains the situation. Observation 1, "Joe was running late for school,"
    suggests that Joe was in a hurry, and likely did not have enough time to cook
    a meal. Observation 2, "Joe had a tasty, healthy breakfast of apples and bananas,"
    suggests that Joe had a quick and easy breakfast that did not require cooking,
    which is consistent with hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 1, on the other hand, implies
    that Joe had enough time to cook something, which seems to contradict observation

    2 (Joe had a tasty, healthy breakfast of apples and bananas) indicates that Joe
    had a simple breakfast that likely didn’t require much time to prepare. Apples
    and bananas can be eaten quickly and don’t require cooking, supporting the idea
    that Joe didn’t have time to cook something more elaborate. | Hypothesis 2: Joe
    didn’t have time to cook something better explains the observations. - Observation
    1: Joe was running late for school. This means that he didn’t have a lot of time
    to prepare his breakfast. - Observation 2: Joe had a tasty, healthy breakfast
    of apples and bananas. This suggests that he didn’t have time to cook something
    more elaborate, such as eggs, pancakes, or waffles. Hypothesis 1, on the other
    hand, is not supported by the observations. If Joe had plenty of time to cook
    something, he would have had time to make something more substantial than apples
    and bananas. Therefore, hypothesis 2 is the better explanation for the observations.
    Here are some additional reasons why hypothesis 2 is more likely: - Apples and
    bananas are relatively easy to prepare. They can be eaten raw, or they can be
    quickly sliced or diced. - Apples and bananas are also relatively healthy. They
    are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. - If Joe was running late
    for school, he would have been more likely to choose a quick and healthy breakfast

    large for her space. Hyp1: "Alexis made sure the tree wasn’t under 20 feet tall"

    would fit in her ceiling. Hypothesis 2: Alexis was worried it would be too big.
    - Observation 1: Alexis had cut down a Christmas tree in the woods. This suggests
    that Alexis did not have complete control over the size of the tree she cut down.
    Observation 2: When she put it up, it was the right size for her ceiling. This
    suggests that Alexis was lucky that the tree she cut down was not too big. Conclusion:
    Hypothesis 1 better explains the observations. This is because hypothesis 1 takes
    into account both observations, while hypothesis 2 only explains observation 2\.
    Hypothesis 1 also makes more sense, as it is more likely that Alexis would have
    taken steps to ensure that the tree was the right size, rather than just hoping
    that it would be. In addition, hypothesis 2 is not supported by the fact that
    Alexis cut down the tree in the woods. If she was worried that the tree would
    be too big, she would have been more likely to cut down a smaller tree in a garden
    or park. Therefore, hypothesis 1 is the more likely explanation for the observations.

    two observations, it is more likely that Hypothesis 1 (Hyp1) "I had enough money

    observation "I saved up money for a long time" suggests that the person had a

    observation "I took the boat out on the lake and felt happy" suggests that the
    person experienced a positive emotion after taking the boat out on the lake. While
    it is possible that the person could have purchased a dream cat and felt happy,
    this observation does not necessarily support the idea of owning a cat as the
    only explanation for feeling happy. Therefore, based on the available information,
    Hypothesis 1 "I had enough money to spend on food and extra stuff" appears to
    be a more plausible explanation for the two observations. | Based on the given
    observations, neither hypothesis directly explains the observations. However,
    Hypothesis 2 (I bought my dream cat) can be considered as a more plausible explanation.
    Here’s why: Obs1: I saved up money for a long time. Obs2: I took the boat out
    on the lake and felt happy. Hyp1: I had enough money to spend on food and extra
    stuff. Hyp2: I bought my dream cat. Although Hypothesis 1 is somewhat related
    to saving money, it doesn’t connect to the second observation about taking the
    boat out on the lake. On the other hand, Hypothesis 2 involves buying something,
    which might have required saving up money for a long time, and it is possible
    that "dream cat" could be a term for a boat or catamaran. Thus, taking the boat
    out on the lake might be related to buying the dream cat(boat). | Hypothesis 1:

    up money for a long time. - Observation 2: I took the boat out on the lake and
    felt happy. - Hypothesis: I had enough money to spend on food and extra stuff.
    This hypothesis does not explain the observations very well. It is possible that
    the person had enough money to spend on food and extra stuff, but it is not clear
    why this would make them feel happy. The person could have been happy for other
    reasons, such as the weather being nice or spending time with friends and family.
    Hypothesis 2: I bought my dream cat. - Observation 1: I saved up money for a long
    time. - Observation 2: I took the boat out on the lake and felt happy. - Hypothesis:
    I bought my dream cat. This hypothesis explains the observations better than the
    first hypothesis. It is clear that the person would be happy if they bought their
    dream cat. The person had been saving up money for a long time, and they were
    finally able to buy their dream cat. This would make them feel happy, and it would
    also explain why they took the boat out on the lake. They were probably taking

    explains the observations: hyp1: Our friends came over so we ordered pizza, but

    driver dropped it. | Based on the given observations, neither hypothesis can be
    confirmed or ruled out definitively, as neither one provides a clear explanation
    for both observations. Here’s why: Observation 1: "My girlfriend Heather and I
    were relaxing and watching Netflix."  Neither hypothesis directly relates to this
    observation, so it doesn’t provide any evidence for or against either hypothesis.
    Observation 2: "We had to give them the old ruined pizza before getting a new
    one."  Both hypotheses suggest that there was a problem with the pizza order.
    However, the difference between "our friends came over" (hypothesis 1) and "our
    friends came under" (hypothesis 2) doesn’t seem to have a significant impact on
    why the pizza was ruined or why they had to give it back. Therefore, this observation
    alone is not sufficient to determine which hypothesis is more likely. In order
    to determine which hypothesis is more likely, additional evidence or observations
    would be needed. For example, if there were witnesses who saw the delivery driver
    drop the pizza, that would support hypothesis 1\. On the other hand, if there

    or a traffic accident. However, hypothesis 1 provides a more specific explanation
    for why the pizza was ruined. It states that the driver dropped the pizza because
    your friends came over unexpectedly. This is a more likely explanation, as it

    It is possible that the disappointment upon waking up could have been caused by
    something unrelated to the dream, or it could have been due to the dream not being

    but it is a possibility that cannot be ruled out based on the information given.

    which hypothesis, if any, better explains the observations. | These observations
    suggest that the dream was enjoyable and likely felt very real, leading to disappointment
    upon waking up and realizing it was just a dream. This aligns well with hyp1\.

    for the disappointment upon waking up. | Hypothesis 1: My dream was very real
    and I was on a fun bike tour. - Observation 1: Last night I had a dream about

    which suggests that they enjoyed the dream and wanted it to continue. Hypothesis
    2: I actually have a bike. - Observation 1: Last night I had a dream about biking.

    both observations. The person had a dream about biking, but there is no reason
    to believe that they would be disappointed if they woke up and found that they
    actually had a bike. Therefore, hypothesis 1 better explains the observations.

    explains the observations than hyp2 (I didn’t practice much). Here’s why: Observation
    1 states that the person was on the track and field team in high school, which
    suggests that they were involved in regular athletic activities. Observation 2
    states that the person lost all their energy and got 5th place. This suggests
    that they had exerted a lot of physical effort during the meet. If the person
    had trained a lot for the meet (hyp1), then it would be more likely that they
    had the physical stamina and endurance to perform well but simply didn’t perform
    well enough to win. On the other hand, if the person didn’t practice much (hyp2),
    it is less likely that they would have had the physical ability to compete at
    a high level and would be more likely to have lost due to lack of conditioning.
    Therefore, based on the given observations, it is more likely that the person
    trained a lot for the meet (hyp1) than they didn’t practice much (hyp2). | Based
    on the two observations provided, hypothesis 2 (I didn’t practice much) better

    in high school) does not provide any direct indication about the amount of training
    or practice, observation 2 (At the end, I lost all my energy and got 5th place)
    suggests that the individual may not have been well-prepared or well-conditioned
    for the event. Losing energy at the end and not securing a higher place could
    be indicative of insufficient practice or training, supporting hypothesis 2. |
    Hypothesis 1: I trained a lot for a meet. Observation 1: I was on the track and
    field team in high school. This observation supports hypothesis 1 because it suggests
    that the person was a dedicated athlete who would have put in a lot of training.
    - Observation 2: At the end, I lost all my energy and got 5th place. This observation

    and not managed their energy levels effectively. Hypothesis 2: I didn’t practice
    much. - Observation 1: I was on the track and field team in high school. This
    observation does not support hypothesis 2 because it suggests that the person

    | 根据给出的观察结果，hyp1（我为比赛进行了大量训练）比hyp2（我没怎么练习）更好地解释了这些观察结果。原因如下：观察结果1表明，这个人高中时是田径队的一员，这表明他们参与了定期的体育活动。观察结果2表明，这个人在比赛结束时耗尽了所有的精力，并获得了第5名。这表明他们在比赛期间付出了大量的体力努力。如果这个人为比赛进行了大量训练（hyp1），那么他们可能有足够的体力和耐力来表现良好，但只是没有表现得足够好以赢得比赛。另一方面，如果这个人没怎么练习（hyp2），他们就不太可能具备高水平竞争的体力，更可能由于体能不足而失败。因此，根据给出的观察结果，这个人为比赛进行了大量训练（hyp1）的可能性更大，而不是没怎么练习（hyp2）。
    | 根据提供的两个观察结果，假设2（我没怎么练习）更好地解释了这些观察结果。虽然观察结果1（我在高中时是田径队的一员）并未直接说明训练或练习的数量，但观察结果2（最后，我耗尽了所有的精力，获得了第5名）表明这个人可能没有为比赛做好充分的准备或体能训练。最后精力耗尽且未获得更高名次可能表明训练或练习不足，支持假设2。

    in the middle of his hike to tie his shoes, is a better explanation than hyp1:
    Bob stopped in the middle of the hike because he had no bug spray. The first observation,
    that Bob decided to hike in the jungles of Indonesia, suggests that he was prepared
    for the hike, or at least had some level of planning. If he was concerned about
    bug spray, he likely would have brought some with him or made arrangements to
    obtain it before embarking on the hike. The second observation, that Bob had forgotten
    his shoes, suggests that he may have been somewhat forgetful or careless in his
    preparations. Forgetting shoes would likely cause discomfort and could even lead
    to injury during a hike, so it is plausible that he would need to stop to address
    the issue. In contrast, hyp1: Bob stopped in the middle of the hike because he
    had no bug spray, does not seem as likely based on the observations. There is

    2, "Ryan loved going down the water slide," better explains the observations.
    Observation 1 states that Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the water

    was scared to go down the water slide (hypothesis option 1), it seems less likely
    that he would have gone through the effort of climbing the stairs to reach the

    was surprised by how much fun it was. Hypothesis 2: Ryan loved going down the
    water slide. - Observation 1: Ryan climbed the long set of stairs to get to the
    water slide. This observation could be explained by the hypothesis that Ryan loved
    going down the water slide and was eager to do it again. He may have thought that
    the water slide was the most fun thing at the pool, and he wanted to make sure
    he got to experience it as many times as possible. - Observation 2: It was even
    more fun than he expected. This observation is easily explained with the hypothesis
    that Ryan loved going down the water slide. If he loved it, then he would have
    expected to have fun, but he would have been surprised by how much fun it actually
    was. Conclusion: The hypothesis that better explains the observations is Hypothesis

    1 (hyp1) suggests that Gina saved Lucy from drowning in the pool. However, this

    If Gina had saved Lucy’s life, there would be no reason for Lucy to ask Gina to

    Lucy talked Gina into keeping the incident a secret. If Gina had called the rescuers
    and saved Lucy’s life, there would be no reason for Lucy to ask Gina to keep it
    a secret. Therefore, we need to consider other possible explanations that could
    account for both observations. One possible explanation could be that Lucy was
    struggling in the pool, and Gina noticed and pulled her out of the water before
    she drowned. However, Lucy felt embarrassed or ashamed about almost drowning and
    asked Gina to keep the incident a secret. This explanation accounts for both observations
    and is consistent with human psychology. | Based on the given observations, neither
    hypothesis directly explains the observations. However, Hyp1: "Suddenly Gina saved
    her" better aligns with the observations. In Obs1, Lucy almost drowned, which
    implies that she was saved before actually drowning. Hyp1 suggests that Gina saved
    her, which is consistent with the event. Additionally, in Obs2, Lucy talked Gina
    into keeping the incident secret, which makes more sense if Gina was directly
    involved in saving her. Hyp2: "Gina called the rescuers" does not fit as well

    Observation 2: Lucy talked Gina into staying and keeping the incident secret.
    This observation is also explained by hypothesis 2\. If Gina called the rescuers,
    then Lucy would not want anyone to know about the incident, especially the rescuers.
    Therefore, hypothesis 2, Gina called the rescuers, better explains the observations

    -2*c - 37 = -5*q + 127\. Is q a composite number? Let’s think step by step. |
    [ 1. Sure, let’s break down the problem step by step. First, let’s find the value
    of r by substituting t = -4 into the expression for n(t): n(t) = 1 + 0t - t +
    0t n(-4) = 1 + 0*(-4) - (-4) + 0*(-4) = 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 5 Therefore, r = n(-4)
    = 5. 2. Now we have the equation -173 = -rq - c. Substituting the value of r,
    we get: -173 = -5q - c 3. We also have the equation -2c - 37 = -5q + 127. 4. Let’s
    rearrange the first equation to express c in terms of q: c = -5*q - 173 5. Substituting
    this value of c into the second equation: -2*(-5q - 173) - 37 = -5q + 127 6. Simplifying
    the equation: 10q + 346 - 37 = -5q + 127 10q + 309 = -5q + 127 7. Combining like
    terms: 15*q = -182 8. Dividing both sides by 15: q = -182/15 q = -12.1333… Now,
    let’s analyze whether q is a composite number. A composite number is defined as
    any integer greater than 1 that is divisible by at least one positive integer
    other than 1 and itself. However, q is not an integer but a decimal approximation
    (-12.1333…). Therefore, it doesn’t fit the criteria for being a composite number.
    In conclusion, q is not a composite number based on the given equations and calculations.
    ] | [ Okay, let’s go step by step. First, we calculate r. The function is n(t)
    = 1 + 0t - t + 0t. This simplifies to n(t) = 1 - t. If we substitute -4 into the
    function, we get: r = n(-4) = 1 - (-4) = 1 + 4 = 5 Now, we know that r = 5. The
    first equation we have is -173 = -r*q - c. Substituting r into the equation, we

    solve the subtraction problem step by step in base 12. To subtract 132 from 5
    in base 12, we start from the rightmost digit and work our way to the left. Step
    1: Subtract the units (ones) place: Since 5 is smaller than 2, we need to borrow
    from the next place value, which is the 12s place. Step 2: Subtract the 12s place:
    Since we borrowed 1 from the 12s place, it becomes 4 in the 12s place. Now, we
    have 11 - 3 = 8 in the 12s place. Step 3: Subtract the 144s place: There are no
    digits in the 144s place, so we don’t need to perform any subtraction. Putting
    it all together, the subtraction of 132 from 5 in base 12 is: 5-132 = 428 Therefore,
    the result of 5 - 132 in base 12 is 428. ] | [ Sure, let’s take this step by step.
    First, let’s clarify the base 12 numbering system. In base 12, the digits go from
    0 to 11, with A representing 10 and B representing 11. The subtraction 5 - 132
    in base 12 needs to be solved with borrowing, similar to how we’d do it in base
    10, but with base 12 rules instead. Let’s write down the numbers: 5 (in base 12)
    132 (in base 12) We can’t subtract 2 from 5 directly because 5 is smaller. So
    we need to borrow from the next higher place value. But there’s a problem: there
    is no next place value from 5\. So what we need to do is imagine there is a 0
    in the tens place and a 0 in the hundreds place. Now, let’s borrow: If we borrow
    1 from the tens place, we get 12 in the ones place (because we’re in base 12,
    remember), but now we have -1 in the tens place. Now we need to borrow 1 from
    the hundreds place to get 11 in the tens place (again, because we’re in base 12).
    But now we have -1 in the hundreds place. So the calculation now looks like this:
    1005 (in base 12) 0132 (in base 12) We can now subtract: In the ones place: 5
    - 2 = 3. In the tens place: 11 - 3 = 8. In the hundreds place: -1 - 1 = -2. So,
    5 - 132 in base 12 is -283 in base 12\. In other words, 132 is 283 more than 5
    in base 12. Keep in mind that the negative sign still works the same way as in
    base 10, indicating that 132 is larger than 5. ] | [ Sure, let’s think step by
    step. First, we need to convert 5 and 132 to base 12. 5 in base 12 is 5. 132 in
    base 12 is 11100. Now, we can subtract 11100 from 5 in base 12. 11100 - 5 —— 11095
    Therefore, 5 - 132 in base 12 is 11095. Here are the steps in more detail: We
    start by subtracting the units digits. 5 - 0 = 5. We then borrow 1 from the tens
    digit of 11100, which gives us 10 - 0 = 10. We then subtract the tens digits.
    10 - 1 = 9. We then borrow 1 from the hundreds digit of 11100, which gives us
    1 - 0 = 1. We then subtract the hundreds digits. 1 - 1 = 0. The result is 11095

- en: '| 6\. Is 19385 prime? Let’s think step by step. | [ To determine if 19385 is
    a prime number, we can proceed step by step. 1. First, we check if the number
    is divisible by 2\. If it is, then it is not a prime number because it has a divisor
    other than 1 and itself. 19385 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
    1. Next, we check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 19385\.
    If any of these numbers divide 19385 without leaving a remainder, then it is not
    a prime number. The square root of 19385 is approximately 139.32, so we only need
    to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 139. 1. We begin by checking divisibility
    by 3\. To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we sum its digits and check
    if the resulting sum is divisible by 3. 1 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 26 1. We continue
    by checking divisibility by 5\. If the last digit of a number is 0 or 5, then
    it is divisible by 5\. However, the last digit of 19385 is 5, so it is not divisible
    by 5. 2. Finally, we check divisibility by 7\. There is no straightforward rule
    like the ones we used for 2, 3, and 5, so we need to perform long division to
    check if 19385 is divisible by 7. $19385/7=2769$ remainder 2 Since the remainder
    is 2, 19385 is not divisible by 7. Based on these steps, we can conclude that
    19385 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers up to 139, indicating that
    it is a prime number. ] | [ Sure, let’s break down how to determine whether a
    number is prime. 1. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive
    divisors: 1 and itself. So, the first step is to understand what 19385’s divisors
    are. 2. A quick method to check if a number is prime is to see if it’s divisible
    by any prime number up to its square root. In this case, the square root of 19385
    is approximately 139.23. 3. We check if 19385 is divisible by any of the prime
    numbers less than 139: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47,
    53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, and 137.
    4. If we check, we find that 19385 is divisible by 5 (since the last digit is
    5). Therefore, it is not a prime number. We can conclude this without having to
    check for divisibility by all the primes listed above. 5. To find the other factor,
    you can divide 19385 by 5 which gives 3877\. So, 19385 = 5 x 3877\. Since 19385
    has more than two distinct divisors (1, 5, 3877, and 19385), it’s not a prime
    number. ] | [ Sure, let’s think step by step. A prime number is a natural number
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural
    number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. To determine
    if 19385 is prime, we can use the following steps: 1\. Check if 19385 is divisible
    by 2\. Since 19385 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. 2\. Check if 19385 is divisible
    by any prime number less than or equal to its square root. The square root of
    19385 is approximately 139\. The only prime numbers less than or equal to 139
    are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23\. None of these numbers divide evenly into
    19385, so 19385 is not divisible by any of them. 3\. Therefore, 19385 is not prime.

    2. 接下来，我们检查19385是否能被小于其平方根的奇数整除。如果这些数字中的任何一个能整除19385而不留余数，那么它就不是质数。19385的平方根大约是139.32，所以我们只需检查小于139的质数。
    3. 我们从检查3的整除性开始。为了确定一个数字是否能被3整除，我们将其各位数字相加，然后检查结果是否能被3整除。 1 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 5 =
    26 4. 然后我们检查是否能被5整除。如果一个数字的最后一位是0或5，那么它能被5整除。然而，19385的最后一位是5，所以它不能被5整除。 5. 最后，我们检查是否能被7整除。没有像2、3和5那样直接的规则，所以我们需要进行长除法来检查19385是否能被7整除。
    $19385/7=2769$ 余数为2 由于余数是2，19385不能被7整除。根据这些步骤，我们可以得出结论：19385不能被139以下的任何质数整除，这表明它是一个质数。
    ] | [ 当然，让我们逐步分析如何确定一个数字是否为质数。 1. 质数是指只有两个不同的正因数：1和它本身的数字。因此，第一步是了解19385的因数是什么。
    2. 检查一个数字是否为质数的快速方法是看它是否能被小于其平方根的质数整除。在这种情况下，19385的平方根大约是139.23。 3. 我们检查19385是否能被小于139的质数整除：2、3、5、7、11、13、17、19、23、29、31、37、41、43、47、53、59、61、67、71、73、79、83、89、97、101、103、107、109、113、127和137。
    4. 如果我们检查，会发现19385能被5整除（因为最后一位是5）。因此，它不是质数。我们可以在不需要检查所有上述质数的情况下得出这个结论。 5. 要找出另一个因数，你可以用5除19385，结果是3877。因此，19385
    = 5 x 3877。由于19385有多个不同的因数（1、5、3877和19385），它不是质数。 ] | [ 当然，让我们一步一步来考虑。质数是大于1的自然数，它不是两个较小的自然数的乘积。大于1且不是质数的自然数称为合数。为了确定19385是否为质数，我们可以使用以下步骤：
    1\. 检查19385是否能被2整除。由于19385是奇数，所以不能被2整除。 2\. 检查19385是否能被小于或等于其平方根的任何质数整除。19385的平方根大约是139。小于或等于139的质数只有2、3、5、7、11、13、17、19和23。没有这些数字能整除19385，因此19385不能被它们中的任何一个整除。

    1: Simplify the expression (-4)/(1056/(-2761)) To divide by a fraction, we can
    multiply by its reciprocal. So, we can rewrite the expression as: (-4) * (-2761/1056)
    Step 2: Multiply the numerators and denominators (-4) * (-2761) = 11044 1056 *

    Sure, let’s break down the expression step by step: 1. Start with the numerator:
    2/20 * 3/(12/32) • Inside the second set of parentheses, we have 3 divided by
    (12 divided by 32). To simplify this, we can multiply the denominator by its reciprocal:
    3 * (32/12) = 8. • Inside the second set of parentheses, we have 3 divided by
    (12 divided by 32). To simplify this, we can multiply the denominator by its reciprocal:
    3 * (32/12) = 8. • Now we have 1/10 * 8, which is 8/10 or 4/5. 2. Move to the
    denominator: (-2082)/(-1041) • Dividing a negative number by another negative
    number results in a positive quotient, so -2082 divided by -1041 is equal to 2.
    3. Now we have (4/5) / 2. • Dividing a fraction by a whole number is the same
    as multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the whole number. Therefore,
    (4/5) / 2 can be written as (4/5) * (1/2). • Multiplying the numerators gives
    us 4, and multiplying the denominators gives us 5 * 2 = 10. • Therefore, (4/5)
    / 2 is equal to 4/10 or 2/5. So the final result of the expression (2/20*3/(12/32))/((-2082)/(-1041))
    is 2/5. ] | [ Sure, let’s break down the expression step by step: Step 1: Simplify
    the numerator. The numerator is (2/20 * 3/(12/32)). First, simplify 2/20 to 1/10.
    Next, simplify 3/(12/32) to 3*(32/12). Now we have (1/10 * 3*(32/12)) in the numerator.
    Step 2: Simplify the denominator. The denominator is (-2082)/(-1041). Dividing
    a negative number by a negative number gives a positive result. So, (-2082)/(-1041)
    simplifies to 2082/1041. Now our expression becomes: (1/10 * 3*(32/12))/(2082/1041)
    Step 3: Simplify the numerator further. To simplify the numerator, let’s calculate
    each part separately. 1/10 * 3 = 3/10. 32/12 can be simplified by dividing both
    numerator and denominator by 4. 32/12 simplifies to 8/3. Now our expression becomes:
    (3/10 * 8/3)/(2082/1041) Step 4: Simplify the denominator further. To simplify
    the denominator, we invert the fraction and multiply. So, (2082/1041) becomes
    (1041/2082). Now our expression becomes: (3/10 * 8/3)/(1041/2082) Step 5: Multiply
    the fractions. When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together
    and the denominators together. So, (3/10 * 8/3) = (3 * 8)/(10 * 3) = 24/30. 24/30
    can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest
    common divisor, which is 6. 24/30 simplifies to 4/5. Now our expression becomes:
    (4/5)/(1041/2082) Step 6: Divide the fractions. To divide fractions, we multiply
    the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. So, (4/5)/(1041/2082)
    becomes (4/5) * (2082/1041). Step 7: Simplify the fraction. To simplify the fraction,
    we can cancel out common factors between the numerators and denominators. In this
    case, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor,
    which is 3. (4/5) * (2082/1041) simplifies to (4 * 2082)/(5 * 1041). This further
    simplifies to 8328/5205. Final answer: The expression (2/20 * 3/(12/32))/((-2082)/(-1041))

    2： -3680 - 20*l - 822 = -3*l - 4434 -4502 - 20*l = -3*l - 4434 第四步：将所有包含 l 的项移到一边：

    x = 920 + 5*(-4) x = 920 - 20 x = 900 现在，我们已找出 x 的值为 900。要确定 78 是否是 x 的因子，我们需要检查
    78 是否能整除 x。用 78 除以 900： 900 ÷ 78 = 11 余 12 由于 78 无法整除 900（余数为 12），因此我们可以得出结论，78
    不是 x 的因子。 ] | [ 当然，我们可以解这个线性方程组来找出 x 和 l 的值，然后确定 78 是否是 x 的因子。方程组为： 1. -x + 5*l
    = -920 2. -4x - 822 = -3l - 4434 首先，我们可以将这些方程重写成更传统的形式： 1. x = 5*l + 920 2. 4x
    = 3l + 3612 然后，我们可以将方程 1) 代入方程 2) 中以求解 l： 4*(5l + 920) = 3l + 3612 20l + 3680
    = 3l + 3612 17*l = -68 l = -68 / 17 l = -4 然后，将 l = -4 代入方程 1) 中以求解 x： x = 5*(-4)
    + 920 x = -20 + 920 x = 900 最后，我们需要检查 78 是否是 900 的因子。一个数是另一个数的因子，如果它能整除那个数（即除法没有余数）。当我们用
    78 除以 900 时，我们得到大约 11.54，这不是一个整数。所以，78 不是 900 的因子，因此在这个方程组中也不是 x 的因子。 ] | [ 当然，让我们一步一步思考。首先，解第一个方程求
    x： -x + 5*l = -920 -x = -920 - 5*l x = 920 + 5*l 现在，解第二个方程求 x： -4*x - 822 = -3*l
    - 4434 -4*x = -3*l - 4434 + 822 -4*x = -3*l - 3612 x = (-3*l - 3612) / -4 x =
    903 - l 我们可以看到这两个方程都得出了相同的 x 值：920 + 5*l 或 903 - l。现在，测试 78 是否是这些值的因子。78 不是 920
    或 903 的因子，因此它也不是 x 的因子。因此，问题的答案是错误的。78 不是 x 的因子。 ] | 错误 |'

    on the given sentence, the cat carefully navigated the area, which suggests that
    the cat is trying to avoid something. Among the given options, the most logical
    answer would be C. falling, as it is a common instinct for cats to avoid falling
    from high places, and their cautious behavior suggests they are trying to avoid
    any potential danger of falling. | The cat carefully navigated the area, they
    do everything they can to avoid what? C. falling | The answer must be something

    Cats are good at climbing and jumping, but they can still fall if they are not
    careful. So the answer is C. falling. The other choices are not as likely. Cats
    do not mind getting wet, and they are not afraid of vegetables. Wool sweaters
    can be uncomfortable for cats, but they are not dangerous. And sharp claws are

    room | The answer to the question "What room is likely to have a sideboard on

    with a flat top and one or more cupboards or drawers underneath. It is often used
    to store dishes, silverware, and other dining room accessories. A sideboard can
    also be used to display decorative objects. The dining room is the most likely
    room in a home to have a sideboard on the counter. This is because the dining
    room is where people eat meals, and a sideboard is a convenient place to store
    food and tableware. Additionally, the dining room is often a formal room, and
    a sideboard can add a touch of elegance to the décor. The other options are not

    it could refer to any room in the house. A serve food buffet is a specific type
    of furniture that is designed for buffet-style dining, and it is not as common

    bounces off the wall in front of you it will make it quiet. The sound dampeners
    should be hung behind you so that they absorb the sound waves that are reflected
    back at you from the wall in front of you. This will help to reduce the echo in
    the room and make your recordings sound cleaner. The other option, hanging the
    sound dampeners in the area that your voice projects, would not be as effective.
    This is because the sound waves would still be reflected off of the walls and
    ceiling, creating an echo. Here are some additional tips for hanging sound dampeners
    in a recording room: - Hang the dampeners at least 2 feet from the floor. - Hang
    the dampeners evenly spaced around the room. - If you have a large room, you may
    need to hang more dampeners. - You can also hang dampeners on the ceiling. By
    following these tips, you can help to create a more acoustically friendly recording
    environment. | 1 |'

    | The correct answer is: "tell the truth about something". Confessions are supposed
    to be honest and truthful admissions of wrongdoing or guilt. Lying in a confession
    defeats the purpose of admitting one’s faults and seeking forgiveness or making
    amends. | how do you give a confession sol2: tell the truth about something |
    The answer is sol2: tell the truth about something. A confession is a statement
    of wrongdoing, typically made to a priest or other authority figure. In order
    to be a confession, the statement must be truthful. If you tell a lie about something,
    it is not a confession. The purpose of a confession is to seek forgiveness for
    wrongdoing and to make amends. If you lie in your confession, you are not truly
    seeking forgiveness or making amends. You are simply trying to avoid punishment.

    seeds in. | To increase the heat in a recipe using jalapenos, you can sol2: Leave
    the seeds in. | The answer is sol1: Remove the seeds. The seeds and the white
    pith of a jalapeño pepper contain most of the capsaicin, which is the compound
    that gives peppers their heat. By removing the seeds and pith, you can significantly
    reduce the heat of a jalapeño pepper. If you want to increase the heat of a recipe
    using jalapeños, you should remove the seeds. Leaving the seeds in will make the
    recipe milder. Here are some other tips for increasing the heat of a recipe using
    jalapeños: - Use more jalapeños. - Use hotter peppers, such as habaneros or scotch
    bonnets. - Roast the jalapeños before using them. This will mellow their flavor
    and slightly increase their heat. - Add a small amount of cayenne pepper or other
    hot pepper flakes. Be careful when handling jalapeños, as even the oils on the
    skin can cause a burning sensation. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling

    between the subjects mentioned. It is unclear whether "Bush" refers to a person
    (e.g., George Bush) or a bush in general, and how it would be connected to burying
    rice. The predicate seems to be a random combination of words, and thus, it is
    difficult to ascertain any plausible meaning or context from it. | The predicate
    "bush bury rice" is implausible. A bush is a plant, and plants do not bury things.
    They can grow rice, but they cannot bury it. The only way that a bush could bury
    rice is if it was being controlled by a human or another animal. However, even
    in that case, it would be a very strange thing to do. The word "bury" means to
    put something underground, usually in a grave. Rice is a food crop, and it is
    not typically buried. It is usually grown in fields or planted in pots. There
    are a few possible scenarios in which the predicate "bush bury rice" could be
    plausible. For example, if a bush was being used as a container for rice, and
    the rice was buried in the ground next to the bush, then the predicate would be
    plausible. However, this is a very specific scenario, and it is not the most likely
    interpretation of the predicate. Overall, the predicate "bush bury rice" is implausible.

    Skyscrapers can contribute to the urban heat island effect, where built-up areas

    such as heat-absorbing materials, energy use, and reduced green spaces. However,

    | The predicate "skyscraper heat air" is plausible. Skyscrapers can be heated
    by a variety of methods, including: - Steam heating: This is the most common method
    of heating skyscrapers. Steam is generated in a boiler and then circulated through
    pipes to radiators in the building. - Hot water heating: This is similar to steam
    heating, but instead of steam, hot water is circulated through the pipes. In addition
    to these methods, skyscrapers can also be heated by the sun’s rays. The concrete

    that better explains the premise "Typhoons frequently occur in coastal areas"
    is Hypothesis 1: "The rainy season is here." Typhoons are often associated with
    heavy rainfall and strong winds, and the rainy season is a time of increased precipitation,
    which can lead to typhoon formation. In contrast, Hypothesis 2, "The weather is
    hot in summer," does not provide a clear explanation for the occurrence of typhoons
    in coastal areas. While it is true that typhoons often occur during the summer
    months, it is the increased rainfall and atmospheric conditions during the rainy
    season that are the primary cause of typhoon formation. | Hypothesis 1 (The rainy
    season is here) better explains the cause of the premise (Typhoons frequently
    occur in coastal areas). Typhoons are tropical cyclones that form over warm ocean
    waters in the western Pacific, usually during the rainy season. The increased
    evaporation and high moisture content during the rainy season create the necessary
    conditions for typhoons to form and strengthen. While hypothesis 2 (The weather
    is hot in summer) is related to typhoon formation due to the warm ocean temperatures,
    it does not fully explain the cause of the premise as typhoons are more specifically
    linked to the rainy season rather than just the hot weather in summer. | The hypothesis
    that better explains the premise is hyp1: The rainy season is here. Typhoons are
    tropical cyclones that form over warm, tropical waters. They require a minimum
    sea surface temperature of 26°C (79°F) to form. The rainy season is typically
    the time of year when sea surface temperatures are warmest, so it is more likely
    that typhoons will form during this time. The hypothesis that the weather is hot
    in summer is not as strong of an explanation. While hot weather can contribute
    to the formation of typhoons, it is not the only factor. Typhoons also require
    high levels of moisture, which are not always present during hot weather. In addition,
    the rainy season is a more specific time period than summer. This makes it a more

    to the dirty blanket. Hyp2, cleaning the inside of the blanket, does not directly
    address the issue of the blanket being dirty, as it focuses on the interior rather
    than the exterior of the blanket. | Hypothesis 2, "He cleaned the inside of the
    blanket," better explains the effect of the premise, "The blanket was dirty."
    This is because the inside of a blanket is typically not exposed to the same amount
    of dirt and grime as the outside, so it would be more likely to remain dirty if
    only the surfaces were cleaned. Additionally, if the inside of the blanket was
    not cleaned, it could still make the person who slept in it dirty, even if the
    outside of the blanket looked clean. Hypothesis 1, "He cleaned the surfaces,"
    is less likely to explain the effect of the premise because it is more likely
    that the surfaces of a blanket would be cleaned than the inside. Additionally,
    even if the surfaces of the blanket were cleaned, the inside could still be dirty,

    The hypothesis that better explains the effect of the premise is hyp2: He was
    assigned to the ward of mumps. The premise states that the patient had a generalized

    1, the patient was diagnosed with ischemia, is not a good explanation for the

    an organ or tissue is reduced or blocked. It is not a symptom of mumps, and it
    is not caused by the mumps virus. Hypothesis 2, he was assigned to the ward of
    mumps, is a better explanation for the effect of the premise. This is because
    patients who are infected with the mumps virus are typically assigned to a ward
    that specializes in treating mumps patients. This allows the patients to receive
    the care they need from doctors and nurses who are experienced in treating mumps.
    In addition, the ward of mumps is typically equipped with the necessary facilities

    of the two hypothesis options, better explains the cause of the premise. hyp1:
    This little man abused inhalants in his life. hyp2: This boy was exposed to contaminated
    rat urine. | Based on the information provided, the second hypothesis appears
    to be a better explanation for the cause of the man’s Leptospirosis diagnosis.
    Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that is often transmitted through contact
    with the urine of infected animals, especially rats. The symptoms of the disease
    can include fever, headache, muscle aches, and vomiting. While inhalant abuse
    can have harmful effects on the body, there is no known link between inhalant
    abuse and Leptospirosis. On the other hand, exposure to contaminated rat urine
    is a well-known risk factor for contracting the disease. Therefore, unless there
    is additional information that suggests inhalant abuse as a possible cause of
    the Leptospirosis diagnosis, the second hypothesis appears to be the more likely
    explanation. | Based on the information provided, hypothesis 2 (This boy was exposed
    to contaminated rat urine) better explains the cause of the premise. Leptospirosis
    is a bacterial infection caused by the Leptospira bacteria, which can be found
    in the urine of infected animals, such as rats. The disease is typically contracted
    through contact with contaminated water, soil, or direct contact with infected
    animals’ urine. Inhalant abuse, as described in hypothesis 1, is not directly
    linked to Leptospirosis. | The hypothesis that better explains the cause of the
    premise is hyp2: This boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine. Leptospirosis
    is a bacterial disease that is spread through the urine of infected animals, including
    rats. Inhalants, on the other hand, are not known to cause leptospirosis. In fact,
    there is no evidence that inhalants can even weaken the immune system enough to
    make someone more susceptible to leptospirosis. Therefore, it is more likely that
    the boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine, which caused him to contract leptospirosis.
    Here are some additional reasons why hyp2 is a better explanation: - Leptospirosis
    is a common disease in rats. - Rat urine can contaminate water and soil, which
    can then be spread to humans through contact with contaminated water or soil.
    - Leptospirosis can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, headache,
    muscle aches, and jaundice. These are all symptoms that the boy was experiencing.
    In contrast, there is no evidence that inhalants can cause any of the symptoms
    of leptospirosis. Additionally, inhalants are not known to be associated with
    any other diseases that have similar symptoms to leptospirosis. Therefore, the
    hypothesis that the boy was exposed to contaminated rat urine is a better explanation
    for the premise that he was diagnosed with leptospirosis. | 2 |'

    | 根据提供的信息，假设2（这个男孩接触了污染的老鼠尿）更好地解释了前提的原因。钩端螺旋体病是一种由钩端螺旋体细菌引起的细菌感染，这些细菌可以在感染动物的尿液中找到，例如老鼠。该疾病通常通过接触污染的水、土壤或直接接触感染动物的尿液来传播。假设1中描述的吸入剂滥用与钩端螺旋体病没有直接联系。
    | 更好地解释前提原因的假设是hyp2：这个男孩接触了污染的老鼠尿。钩端螺旋体病是一种通过感染动物的尿液传播的细菌性疾病，包括老鼠。另一方面，吸入剂不会导致钩端螺旋体病。实际上，没有证据表明吸入剂能削弱免疫系统到足以使人更容易感染钩端螺旋体病。因此，这个男孩更可能是接触了污染的老鼠尿液，从而感染了钩端螺旋体病。以下是一些额外的理由说明hyp2是更好的解释：-
    钩端螺旋体病在老鼠中很常见。- 老鼠尿液可以污染水源和土壤，之后通过接触污染的水或土壤传播给人类。- 钩端螺旋体病可以引起一系列症状，包括发热、头痛、肌肉疼痛和黄疸。这些都是男孩所经历的症状。相反，没有证据表明吸入剂会引起钩端螺旋体病的任何症状。此外，吸入剂也没有与任何其他类似症状的疾病相关联。因此，假设这个男孩接触了污染的老鼠尿液是对他被诊断为钩端螺旋体病的前提的更好解释。

    hypothesis options, better explains the cause of the premise. hyp1: Lucy suffers
    from diabetes. hyp2: Sophia has some small spherical opaque white protrusions
    on her face. | Neither of the two hypothesis options seems to be a good explanation
    for the premise "Her eyes are affected." The premise does not provide enough information
    to determine whose eyes are affected or what is causing the issue. However, if
    we assume that "her" refers to Lucy or Sophia, we can evaluate the two hypothesis
    options in terms of their plausibility as causes of the eye problem: - Hypothesis
    1: Lucy suffers from diabetes.  If Lucy has uncontrolled diabetes, it can lead
    to various complications affecting the eyes, such as diabetic retinopathy, cataracts,
    and glaucoma. However, the premise only mentions that "her eyes are affected,"
    without providing any specific symptoms or details that could point to a diabetic
    eye problem. Therefore, this hypothesis cannot be confirmed or rejected based
    on the given information. - Hypothesis 2: Sophia has some small spherical opaque
    white protrusions on her face.  The presence of white protrusions on Sophia’s
    face does not necessarily explain why "her eyes are affected." It is possible
    that the eye problem is unrelated to the skin issue, or that it is caused by a
    different condition altogether. Therefore, this hypothesis is also not a good
    explanation for the premise. In summary, without more information, it is impossible
    to determine which hypothesis, if any, is a better explanation for the premise
    "Her eyes are affected." | Based on the given premise, hypothesis 2 better explains
    the cause of the affected eyes. In hypothesis 2, the presence of small spherical
    opaque white protrusions on Sophia’s face could potentially be affecting her eyesight,
    either by obstructing her vision or causing other eye-related issues. Hypothesis
    1 mentions that Lucy suffers from diabetes, but since the premise is about "her"
    eyes being affected, it is not clear if "her" refers to Lucy or another person.
    Furthermore, while diabetes can lead to eye-related complications, it is not as
    direct a cause as the physical obstruction in hypothesis 2. | Hypothesis 1: Lucy
    suffers from diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how the body
    turns food into energy. It can cause a number of health problems, including damage
    to the eyes. Diabetes can cause the blood vessels in the eyes to narrow, which
    can lead to blurry vision, difficulty seeing at night, and even blindness. Hypothesis
    2: Sophia has some small spherical opaque white protrusions on her face. These
    protrusions are called xanthelasmas. They are fatty deposits that can form on
    the eyelids. Xanthelasmas are not usually harmful, but they can be a sign of high
    cholesterol or other health problems. Which hypothesis is more likely to explain
    the premise? Hypothesis 1 is more likely to explain the premise. Diabetes is a
    well-known cause of eye problems, and it is more common than xanthelasmas. Additionally,
    the premise only mentions that the person’s eyes are affected, not that they have
    any other symptoms. This makes it more likely that the cause is diabetes, as xanthelasmas
    often have other symptoms, such as high cholesterol. However, it is still possible
    that hypothesis 2 is correct. If the person has other symptoms of high cholesterol,
    such as chest pain or shortness of breath, then hypothesis 2 is more likely. Ultimately,
    more information is needed to determine which hypothesis is correct. | 1 |'

    it is not safe for the drug to pass into breast milk and be ingested by the baby.
    When hydrazine is ingested by a baby, it can cause a number of adverse reactions,
    including seizures, respiratory problems, and even death. There is no evidence
    to suggest that hydrazine can cause a woman’s breasts to become bigger. In fact,

    The Myofibrils have different numbers of myofilaments. | Neither of the two hypotheses
    (hyp1: scientists study the paramagnetism of atoms; hyp2: the Myofibrils have
    different numbers of myofilaments) directly explains the premise that scientists
    have discovered the permanent magnetic moment of atoms. The permanent magnetic
    moment of an atom refers to the magnetic dipole moment that arises from the intrinsic
    properties of the atom, such as the spin and orbital motion of its electrons.
    It is a fundamental property of atoms that has been known and studied for many
    years. Hypothesis 1 (scientists study the paramagnetism of atoms) is related to
    the magnetic properties of materials, including the paramagnetic behavior of some
    materials in the presence of an external magnetic field. While this is an interesting
    topic of study, it does not directly relate to the discovery of the permanent
    magnetic moment of atoms. Hypothesis 2 (the Myofibrils have different numbers
    of myofilaments) is unrelated to the topic of atomic magnetism. Myofibrils are
    organelles found in muscle cells that are involved in muscle contraction and do
    not have any direct connection to the magnetic properties of atoms. Therefore,
    a more appropriate hypothesis to explain the discovery of the permanent magnetic
    moment of atoms might be that scientists have used advanced experimental techniques
    such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging
    (MRI) to directly measure and characterize the magnetic properties of individual
    atoms. | Based on the given premise, Hypothesis 1 (Scientists study the paramagnetism

    involves the discovery of the permanent magnetic moment of atoms, which is directly
    related to their magnetic properties. Paramagnetism is a type of magnetism that
    occurs in certain materials, like atoms or molecules, which have permanent magnetic
    moments due to the presence of unpaired electrons. Therefore, studying paramagnetism
    would provide a better understanding of the magnetic properties of atoms, including
    their permanent magnetic moment. On the other hand, Hypothesis 2 (The Myofibrils

    related to the magnetic properties of atoms. Myofibrils are structures within
    muscle cells that are composed of repeating sections called sarcomeres, which
    contain myofilaments. The number of myofilaments in myofibrils is unrelated to
    the magnetic properties of atoms and does not provide any useful information to
    explain the given premise. | Hypothesis 1 is the better explanation for the premise.
    - Hypothesis 1: Scientists study the paramagnetism of atoms. * Paramagnetism is
    a property of atoms that have unpaired electrons. These unpaired electrons create
    a magnetic field, which is what gives atoms their permanent magnetic moment. *

    the permanent magnetic moment of atoms. - Hypothesis 2: The Myofibrils have different
    numbers of myofilaments. * Myofibrils are the contractile units of muscle cells.
    They are made up of myofilaments, which are the individual fibers that make up
    the myofibril. * The number of myofilaments in a myofibril can vary depending
    on the type of muscle cell. However, the number of myofilaments does not affect

    Hypothesis 2: He had the same symptoms. This hypothesis is more supported by the

    is caused by the same underlying condition. However, this hypothesis is still
    not definitive, as there could be other explanations for why he is experiencing
    the same symptoms. Ultimately, more information is needed to determine which hypothesis
    is better supported by the premise. For example, if we knew more about the specific
    symptoms he is experiencing, or if we knew about his medical history, then we
    would be able to make a more informed decision. Based on the information that

    of the chemical reaction. | Based on the given premise, the hypothesis option
    that better explains the cause of the premise is hyp1: "The racers entered the
    deceleration phase." This is because the statement "Bob decreased the speed to
    50km/h" implies that there was some kind of motion or movement involved, and the
    use of the word "decreased" suggests a deliberate action taken by someone. Additionally,
    the context of "the racers" suggests that there was some kind of competition or
    race happening, which makes it more likely that the decrease in speed was due
    to a deceleration phase or strategy being employed. On the other hand, hyp2: "Tom
    wants to accelerate the speed of the chemical reaction" does not seem to be related
    to the given premise at all. There is no mention of any chemical reaction or any
    indication that such a reaction is even taking place. Therefore, hyp2 does not
    provide a plausible explanation for the cause of the given premise. | Based on
    the given premise, hypothesis 1: "The racers entered the deceleration phase" better
    explains the cause of the premise. This is because the premise specifically talks
    about Bob decreasing the speed, which is related to a change in velocity or pace,
    consistent with the concept of a deceleration phase in racing. Hypothesis 2: "Tom
    wants to accelerate the speed of the chemical reaction" is unrelated to the premise
    as it discusses a chemical reaction and involves a different person, Tom. | Hypothesis
    1, The racers entered the deceleration phase, is a better explanation for the

    phase is a natural part of racing, and it is typically accompanied by a decrease
    in speed. Hypothesis 2, Tom wants to accelerate the speed of the chemical reaction,
    is not a good explanation for the premise because it is not clear how decreasing

    Based solely on the premise "They found a lot of food," neither hypothesis can
    be definitively confirmed or ruled out. However, we can evaluate each hypothesis
    based on what we know about the context and likelihood. Hypothesis 1: The hunter
    caught a lot of squirrels. This hypothesis suggests that the food was obtained
    through hunting. If the environment is suitable for squirrels and the hunter has
    the necessary skills, it’s plausible that they could catch a lot of squirrels.
    However, this hypothesis doesn’t account for the possibility of finding other
    types of food, such as fruits, vegetables, or fish. Hypothesis 2: They are the
    first settlers on this island. This hypothesis suggests that the food was obtained
    through exploration and discovery. If the settlers are the first people to arrive
    on the island, they would have to rely on the resources available on the island.
    It’s possible that the island has an abundance of food sources, which could explain
    why they found a lot of food. Ultimately, without additional information, it’s
    impossible to say which hypothesis is more likely. However, both hypotheses offer
    potential explanations for the discovery of a lot of food, and the likelihood
    of each hypothesis could depend on the specific context and circumstances. | Given
    the premise: "They found a lot food," it is difficult to definitively say which
    hypothesis better explains the cause. However, Hypothesis 1: "The hunter caught
    a lot of squirrels" has a more direct link to finding food, as it specifically
    mentions a hunter catching squirrels, which could be considered as food. Hypothesis
    2: "They are the first settlers on this island" doesn’t directly relate to finding
    food, as it only states they are the first settlers, but it does not explain how
    they found a lot of food. Based on this analysis, Hypothesis 1 seems to better
    explain the cause of the premise. | Hypothesis 1: The hunter caught a lot of squirrels.
    This hypothesis is more likely to explain the premise because it is more specific
    and provides a clear mechanism for how the people found a lot of food. The hunter
    would have had to be skilled in hunting squirrels, and the squirrels would have
    had to be abundant in the area. This hypothesis is also more plausible because
    it is consistent with our knowledge of how humans have traditionally found food.
    Hypothesis 2: They are the first settlers on this island. This hypothesis is less
    likely to explain the premise because it is less specific and does not provide
    a clear mechanism for how the people found a lot of food. It is possible that
    the first settlers on an island would have found a lot of food, but it is also
    possible that they would have found very little food. This hypothesis is also
    less plausible because it is not consistent with our knowledge of how humans have

    explains the effect of the premise: "After a few days, the eggs turned into parasites."
    This hypothesis aligns with the typical life cycle of a parasite, wherein they

    2: After a few days, the eggs turned into parasites. Which hypothesis better explains

    parasites need a host to survive. Once the eggs hatch, they will need to find
    a host in order to continue their lifecycle. If the eggs were to die, they would
    not be able to find a host and would eventually die out. Hypothesis 1 is not as

    fish tank," does not provide a clear explanation for how the fish were electrocuted.
    While the cephalopods could potentially harm the fish in other ways, it is unlikely
    that they would cause an electrical shock. Therefore, hypothesis 1 is the better
    explanation for the premise given. | Hyp1: Tom connected a socket and a fish tank
    with a wire. This hypothesis directly implies that an electrical current was introduced
    to the fish tank through the wire connected to a socket. This could result in
    the electrocution of the fishes in the tank, which aligns with the given premise.
    Hyp2: Nadal put cephalopods in a fresh water fish tank. Introducing cephalopods
    to a freshwater fish tank would likely cause harm to the cephalopods themselves,
    as they are generally adapted to living in saltwater environments. However, this
    hypothesis does not provide any direct evidence or connection to the fishes in
    the tank being electrocuted. Based on the available information, Hyp1 better explains
    the cause of the premise as it directly involves the introduction of an electrical
    current into the fish tank, which could result in electrocution of the fishes.
    | Hypothesis 1 (H1) is more likely to explain the premise than hypothesis 2 (H2).
    - H1 states that Tom connected a socket and a fish tank with a wire. This would
    create a direct current (DC) electrical current that would flow through the water
    in the tank, electrocuting the fish. - H2 states that Nadal put cephalopods in
    a fresh water fish tank. Cephalopods are saltwater creatures, and their bodies
    are adapted to the high salinity of saltwater. When placed in freshwater, their
    bodies will begin to lose water, which can lead to death. However, electrocution
    would be a much more immediate and likely cause of death for the fish. In addition,
    H1 is supported by the fact that the fish were found to be electrocuted. This
    suggests that they were exposed to a significant amount of electrical current,
    which is more likely to occur if a wire was connected to the tank. H2 is not supported
    by any evidence, and in fact, it is unlikely that the fish would have died simply
    from being placed in freshwater. Therefore, H1 is a more likely explanation for
    the premise than H2. | 1 |'

    Neither hypothesis is entirely accurate as there are a few issues with them. Firstly,
    Mary is typically a female name, and it’s more appropriate to use "she" instead
    of "he." Secondly, the Greek letter for "A" is not the same as the Latin letter
    "A." With that said, hypothesis 1 is more accurate as it correctly identifies
    the first letter that Mary is learning as alpha. Hypothesis 2 is incorrect as
    it assumes that the first letter Mary is learning is the Latin letter "A," which
    is not relevant to the context of learning the Greek alphabet. So, in summary,
    hypothesis 1 is the better explanation as it correctly identifies the first letter
    Mary is learning as alpha, which is a Greek letter. | Given the premise that Mary
    is learning the Greek alphabet, hypothesis 1 (The first letter he learns is alpha)
    better explains the effect of the premise. This is because "alpha" is the first
    letter of the Greek alphabet, while "A" is the first letter of the Latin alphabet,
    which is not being learned in this scenario. | Hypothesis 1 (H1) is a better explanation
    of the effect of the premise than Hypothesis 2 (H2). - H1: The first letter he
    learns is alpha. - H2: The first letter he learns is A. The Greek alphabet has
    24 letters, and the first letter is alpha. Therefore, it is more likely that Mary
    would learn alpha first than any other letter. Additionally, the letter alpha
    is the equivalent of the letter A in the Latin alphabet, so it makes sense that
    Mary would learn alpha first if she is already familiar with the Latin alphabet.
    In conclusion, Hypothesis 1 is a better explanation of the effect of the premise
    than Hypothesis 2 because it is more specific to the Greek alphabet and it is
    more likely that Mary would learn alpha first. | 1 |'

    are skilled in all aspects of construction, which includes building and repairing
    homes, businesses, and other structures. They are also skilled in using a variety
    of tools and materials. If a company or organization needs a person who is skilled
    in all aspects of construction, then they would likely recruit a carpenter. This
    is because carpenters have the skills and experience necessary to complete a wide

    of a leech. Additionally, the length of eight inches is within the range of typical
    sizes for many species of leeches. Therefore, it is more likely that the creature
    is an eight-inch-long leech rather than an 18-inch-long one. | Based on the given
    premise, "It is a leech," we can reasonably assume that the creature attaching
    to Tom’s leg is a type of blood-sucking parasite. Now, we need to evaluate which

    that an eight-inch-long creature is attaching to Tom’s leg and sucking blood.
    Leeches typically range in size from a few millimeters to several inches in length,

    there are some species of leeches that can grow quite large, an 18-inch-long leech
    would be extremely rare, if it exists at all. Additionally, an 18-inch-long creature
    attaching to Tom’s leg and sucking blood could potentially be something other
    than a leech, such as a snake or other large predator. Therefore, Hypothesis 2
    is less plausible as an explanation for the given premise. Based on the above
    analysis, Hypothesis 1 is the better explanation for the given premise. | The
    hypothesis that better explains the cause of the premise is hyp2: An 18-inch-long
    creature is attaching to Tom’s leg and sucking blood. This is because the premise
    states that it is a leech. Leeches are typically 1-2 inches long, so an 8-inch-long
    creature would be too large to be a leech. An 18-inch-long creature, on the other
    hand, is a more reasonable size for a leech. Additionally, the premise states
    that the creature is sucking blood. Leeches are hematophagous, which means they
    feed on blood. An 8-inch-long creature could potentially suck blood, but an 18-inch-long
    creature would be more likely to be able to do so. Therefore, the hypothesis that

- en: '| 2\. Given the context: [Tritoniopsis] Tritoniopsis is a genus of flowering
    plants in the family Iridaceae, first described as a genus in 1926\. The entire
    genus is endemic to Cape Province in South Africa. The genus name refers to the
    African genus "Tritonia" and is combined with the Greek word "opsis", meaning
    "look-alike". [Grex (horticulture)] The term grex (pl. greges or grexes; abbreviation
    gx), derived from the Latin noun "grex, gregis" meaning ’flock’, has been coined
    to expand botanical nomenclature to describe hybrids of orchids, based solely
    on their parentage. Grex names are one of the three categories of plant names
    governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants; within
    a grex the "cultivar group" category can be used to refer to plants by their shared
    characteristics (rather than by their parentage), and individual orchid plants
    can be selected (and propagated) and named as cultivars. [Phyteuma] Phyteuma is
    a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae, native to Europe and
    Morocco. [Zygotritonia] Zygotritonia is a genus of herbaceous, perennial and bulbous
    plants in the Iris family (Iridaceae). It contains four species distributed in
    Tropical Africa. The genus name is derived from the word zygomorphic (meaning
    bilabiate), and the apparent resemblance to some species in the genus "Tritonia".
    [List of plants by common name] This is a list of plants organized by their common
    names. However, the common names of plants often vary from region to region, which
    is why most plant encyclopedias refer to plants using their scientific names,
    in other words using binomials or "Latin" names. [International Plant Names Index]
    The International Plant Names Index (IPNI) describes itself as "a database of
    the names and associated basic bibliographical details of seed plants, ferns and
    lycophytes." Coverage of plant names is best at the rank of species and genus.
    It includes basic bibliographical details, associated with the names, and its
    goals include eliminating the need for repeated reference to primary sources for
    basic bibliographic information about plant names. [Botanical garden] A botanical
    garden or botanic garden is a garden dedicated to the collection, cultivation
    and display of a wide range of plants labelled with their botanical names. It
    may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent plants,
    herb gardens, plants from particular parts of the world, and so on; there may
    be greenhouses, shadehouses, again with special collections such as tropical plants,
    alpine plants, or other exotic plants. Visitor services at a botanical garden
    might include tours, educational displays, art exhibitions, book rooms, open-air
    theatrical and musical performances, and other entertainment. [Thonningia] Thonningia
    is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Balanophoraceae containing
    the single species Thonningia sanguinea. It is distributed throughout much of
    southern and western Africa, particularly the tropical regions. Common names for
    the plant include ground pineapple. A familiar plant to humans, it has an extremely
    long list of common names in many African languages. Many names are inspired by
    the resemblance of the plant’s inflorescence to a pineapple or palm tree. Some
    of the names can be translated as pineapple of the bush (from Anyi), duiker’s
    kolanut (from Igala), and crown of the ground (from Yoruba). [Vascular plant]
    Vascular plants (from Latin "vasculum": duct), also known as tracheophytes (from
    the equivalent Greek term "trachea") and also higher plants, form a large group
    of plants (c. 308,312 accepted known species ) that are defined as those land
    plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals
    throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem)
    to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses,
    horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering
    plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta and Tracheobionta.
    [Tritonia (plant)] Tritonia (flame freesia) is a genus of flowering plants in
    the iris family first described as a genus in 1802\. They are naturally distributed
    across southern Africa, with a high concentration of species in Cape Province
    of western South Africa. The genus is closely related to the genus "Ixia". Based
    on the given context above, answer the question: Tritonia and Phyteuma are both
    names for a what of plants? | Tritonia and Phyteuma are both names for a genus
    of flowering plants. | Tritonia and Phyteuma are both names for a genus of flowering

    [Thonningia] Thonningia 是隶属于巴兰科科的一个单型开花植物属，包含唯一物种 Thonningia sanguinea。它分布于南部和西部非洲的大部分地区，特别是热带地区。该植物的常见名称包括地面菠萝。作为人类熟悉的植物，它在许多非洲语言中有着极长的常见名称列表。许多名称受到植物花序与菠萝或棕榈树的相似性的启发。一些名称可以翻译为丛林中的菠萝（来自
    Anyi）、斑羚的科拉果（来自 Igala）和地面的冠冕（来自 Yoruba）。 [维管植物] 维管植物（来自拉丁语“vasculum”：管道），也称为导管植物（来自等同的希腊语术语“trachea”）以及高等植物，形成了一个大型植物群体（约
    308,312 个公认的已知物种），其定义为那些具有木质化组织（木质部）以进行水分和矿物质运输的陆生植物。它们还具有专门的非木质组织（韧皮部）以运输光合作用产物。维管植物包括石松、马尾、蕨类植物、裸子植物（包括针叶树）和被子植物（开花植物）。该组的科学名称包括
    Tracheophyta 和 Tracheobionta。 [Tritonia (植物)] Tritonia（火焰弗利西亚）是隶属于鸢尾科的一个开花植物属，首次描述为一个属是在1802年。它们自然分布在南部非洲，特别是在南非西部的开普省有着高度的物种集中。该属与属“Ixia”关系密切。根据上述上下文，回答问题：Tritonia

    until 2009 with eventual reconciliation and the release of their second official
    album "Grimlenz", produced mostly by Antagonist Dragonspit of Virginia Beach,VA.

    is a film genre defined by a thriller with a thematic basis in illicit romance
    or erotic fantasy. Though most erotic thrillers contain scenes of softcore sex,
    the frequency and explicitness of those scenes varies. If a film is a thriller
    with scenes of softcore sex or nudity, it is probably not an erotic thriller unless
    illicit romance or erotic fantasy is central to the dramatic conflict, as in "Body
    Heat", "Fatal Attraction", and "Night Eyes 3". Many crime thrillers, action films,
    and slasher films contain softcore sex and/or nudity but are not erotic thrillers.
    Likewise, if a film is not identifiably a thriller, it is probably not an erotic
    thriller but simply a work of softcore erotica or perhaps even erotic melodrama.

    Student Rugby League World Cup, also known as the University Rugby League World
    Cup, first took place in 1986 in New Zealand, when the then five test nations
    each entered a side in what was the first non-first grade World Cup hosted by
    the Rugby League International Federation. [1991 Rugby World Cup] The 1991 Rugby
    World Cup was the second edition of the Rugby World Cup, and was jointly hosted
    by England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France; at that time, the five European
    countries that participated in the Five Nations Championship making it the first
    Rugby World Cup to be staged in the northern hemisphere, with England as the host
    of the championship game. Following on from the success of the inaugural 1987
    Rugby World Cup, the 1991 World Cup received increased attention and was seen
    as a major global sporting event for the first time. Also for the first time qualifying
    competitions were introduced as the number of entrants had increased from 16 nations
    four years before to a total of 33 countries, the eight quarter-finalists from
    1987 qualified automatically with the remaining 25 countries having to qualify
    for the remaining eight spots. This however resulted in only one new side qualifying
    for the tournament, Western Samoa replacing Tonga. The same 16-team pool/knock-out
    format was used with just minor changes to the points system. [2002 FIFA World
    Cup] The 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th staging of the FIFA World Cup which
    took place from 31 May to 30 June 2002 in South Korea and Japan. It was the first
    World Cup to be held in Asia, the first to be held on a continent other than Europe
    or the Americas, the last World Cup during which the golden goal rule was in force
    and the only World Cup to be jointly hosted by more than one nation. Brazil won
    the tournament for a record fifth time, winning the final against Germany 2–0\.
    The victory meant Brazil qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup for the
    fifth time, representing the World. In the third place play-off match against
    South Korea, Turkey won 3–2 taking third place in only their second ever FIFA
    World Cup finals. China PR, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia made their first appearances
    at the finals with Turkey making its first appearance since 1954\. Republic of
    Ireland, Russia and Sweden returned after missing the 1998 tournament. [1968–69

    in Belgium. Standard Club Liégeois won their 4th Division I title. No Belgian
    club managed to pass the second round of the European competitions, though for
    the first time 6 Belgian clubs qualified (1 more club qualified for the Inter-Cities
    Fairs Cup). K Lierse SK won the Belgian Cup final against RR White (2-0). The
    Belgium national football team continued their 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification
    campaign with 3 home wins against all other Group 6 teams (Finland, Yugoslavia
    and Spain) and a draw in Spain. Belgium qualified for the 1970 FIFA World Cup
    finals in Mexico with one match to go. For the first time since the 1954 FIFA
    World Cup, Belgium would qualify for a major tournament. [Orvar Bergmark] Orvar
    Bergmark (16 November 1930 – 10 May 2004) was a Swedish football defender and
    manager. He was the second Swedish national manager ever, and managed to qualify
    the Swedish national football team for the FIFA World Cup in Mexico 1970, after
    having beaten France (among others) in the qualifications. The 1970 World Cup
    was the first one in 12 years, and it was also the first time in 20 years that
    Sweden had "qualified" for a World Cup. (Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup,
    and hence did not need to qualify.) Sweden did not qualify for the World Cups
    in 1954, 1962 and 1966). [Ukraine national football team] The Ukraine’s National
    Football Team, is the national football team of Ukraine and is controlled by the
    Football Federation of Ukraine. After Ukrainian Independence and the country’s
    breakaway from the Soviet Union, they played their first match against Hungary
    on 29 April 1992\. The team’s biggest success on the world stage was reaching
    the quarter-finals in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which also marked the team’s debut
    in the finals of a major championship. As the host nation, Ukraine automatically
    qualified for UEFA Euro 2012\. Four years later, Ukraine qualified for Euro 2016
    via the play-off route, the first time qualifying for a UEFA European Championship
    via the qualifying process, as it finished in third place in its qualifying group.
    This marked the first time in Ukraine’s five play-off appearances that it managed
    to win such a tie, previously unsuccessful in the play-off ties for the Euro 2000,
    2002 World Cup, 2010 World Cup and 2014 World Cup. [Algeria at the FIFA World
    Cup] Algeria have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on four occasions
    in 1982, 1986, 2010 and 2014\. They have once qualified for the knockout rounds,
    reaching the round of 16 in 2014 before losing to Germany. 32 years before, Algeria
    nearly qualified to the second round of the 1982 World Cup after beating both
    West Germany and Chile; however, an arrangement match between West Germany and
    Austria wound up eliminating the Algerians. In 2014, Algeria qualifyed for the
    first time into the round of 16\. [Switzerland women’s national football team]
    The Switzerland women’s national football team represents Switzerland in international
    women’s football. The team played its first match in 1972\. Their most recent
    competition is qualification for the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, and they had
    qualified as the best team in their group. It would be the first time that Switzerland
    participated in a women’s World Cup, and the first time both the men’s team and
    women’s team qualified for a World Cup simultaneously. Based on the given context
    above, answer the question: Where was the world cup hosted that Algeria qualified

    opposite Raveena Rajput in "Ninnu Choodalani" (2001), a romantic drama directed

    acting ability. Later that same year, he had similar roles in two coming-of-age
    romantic dramas, wherein he portrayed college-going students: "Student No. 1"
    and "Subbu", the former being his major break into Tollywood. 2002 marked a turning
    point in his career, with two low-budget films, "Aadi" and "Allari Ramudu", becoming
    box-office hits. The former, an action drama, received highly positive reviews,
    with critics marking the improvement in his performance, while the latter, a melodrama,
    received mixed reviews, but did well at the box office. "Aadi" also did well financially,
    becoming the third highest-grossing film of 2002\. He acted in two films in 2003,
    "Naaga", and "Simhadri". While the former was a forgettable film, the latter became
    a huge blockbuster. The success of "Simhadri" not only cemented his position in
    Tollywood, but also led to him selecting scripts with similar roles. He followed
    this success by portraying leading roles in a series of critical and commercial
    failures, including "Andhrawala" (2004), "Samba" (2004), "Naa Alludu" (2005),
    "Narasimhudu" (2005), and "Ashok" (2006), leading critics to believe that his
    career was over. However, in 2006, his career prospects improved when he played
    the role of Ramakrishna, an unemployed youngster avenging his sister’s death,
    in director Krishna Vamsi’s drama thriller "Rakhi". The film received highly positive

    garage punk band from Portland, Oregon, formed by Fred Cole previously of the
    garage rock band, The Lollipop Shoppe. Cole played guitar and sang, his wife,
    "Toody" played bass and sang, and initially Rod Rat played drums. Their sound
    was a raw mix of punk rock with occasional country touches. Their self-titled
    debut album appeared on Cole’s Whizeagle label in 1980\. Soon after, Rod Rat left
    the band, though he guested on the 1981 follow-up "Intermittent Signals" before
    his death by suicide. (Prior to his suicide Rod Rat (aka Rod Hibbert) also played
    drums in 1980-81 for Portland power pop band Domino Theory). Sam Henry, formerly
    of the Wipers, played drums on this LP but left to join another Portland band,
    Napalm Beach. Louis Samora was on the drum throne for the 1983 album "In a Desperate
    Red", still on Whizeagle. Samora left in 1984 to concentrate on his rockabilly
    band, The Jackals. The band broke up, but Bill Barker of Profile Studios in Vancouver,
    British Columbia convinced the band to reunite for a single. It appeared under
    the band name The Desperate Edge later in 1984\. Soon after, Cole assembled a
    country band, Western Front, and he and Toody later reunited in Dead Moon. The
    Rats’ records have long been out of print and sell for high prices on eBay. In
    2008, Portland’s Mississippi Records reissued the first album on vinyl. [All Join

    song had previously impacted radio on August 12\. This is the band’s 3rd No.1
    single on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart after "Come Out and Play" and "Hit
    That". The song stayed at No. 1 for 11 weeks, making it the longest consecutive
    run for any Offspring single at No. 1\. "You’re Gonna Go Far, Kid" is certified
    Gold by the RIAA; despite this, "Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace" has never been
    certified by the RIAA. It also reached No. 1 on KROQ’s Top 106.7 songs of 2008
    countdown list. It is the band’s most successful hit of the 2000s and overall
    one of the most popular songs by the band. On the album Rise and Fall, Rage and

    producing other Canadian bands including Billy Talent and Three Days Grace). Videos

    "Infected" became a top 10 modern rock hit in Canada. The band has toured with
    Theory of a Deadman, Social Code, The Trews and Hedley, Yellowcard among others.
    A few years before "Into the Existence", Rides Again was known for their hit song
    "Geeze Louise", a pop rock song popular among young teens. The band was incorporated
    with Vodoo Records at this time, playing across southern Ontario. At this time
    the original drummer and cousin of Nathan and Chad, Bradley Christiansen, was
    in the band, but had left later on to pursue other career options. 2007 seemed
    to be the year for the striving Canadian band having their music videos published
    on Much Music, and Much More Music as well as radio stations across Canada. In
    mid-2009, Mike McElroy resigned as Rides Again drummer to pursue other importances.
    After Mike left they asked drummer and musician Kelly Voelkel to join the band,
    Kelly performed all of the drums and percussion on Hollowick’s upcoming album.
    In July 2009 Kelly left to pursue more professional endeavours. Friend Anthony
    Moreino and former Rides Again merchandise guy filled in on drums for a short
    time for Hollowick, until new drummer Frank Goerz was found. With Goerz now behind
    the drum kit, there’s a new level of explosive energy never felt before for Hollowick.

    from J. R. R. Tolkien’s legendarium. He was introduced in the 1937 fantasy novel

    the Gladden Fields. Originally known as Sméagol, he was corrupted by the One Ring
    and later named Gollum after his habit of making "a horrible swallowing noise
    in his throat". [From Unknown Worlds] From Unknown Worlds is an anthology of fantasy
    fiction short stories edited by John W. Campbell, Jr. and illustrated by Edd Cartier,
    the first of a number of anthologies drawing their contents from the classic magazine
    "Unknown" of the 1930s-40s. It was first published in magazine format by American
    company Street & Smith in 1948; the publication was an attempt to determine if
    there was a market for a revived "Unknown". Street & Smith printed 300,000 copies,
    against the advice of John Campbell, but although it sold better than the original,
    too many copies were returned for the publisher to be willing to revive the magazine.
    The first British edition was issued by Atlas Publishing in 1952; part of the

    Harp." . [Suanfa tongzong] Suanfa tongzong (General Source of Computational Methods)
    is a mathematical text written by sixteenth century Chinese mathematician Cheng
    Dawei (1533–1606) and published in the year 1592\. The book contains 595 problems
    divided into 17 chapters. The book is essentially general arithmetic for the abacus.
    The book was the main source available to scholars concerning mathematics as it
    developed in China’s tradition. Six years after the publication of Suanfa Tongzong,
    Cheng Dawei published another book titled "Suanfa Zuanyao" ("A Compendium of calculating
    Methods"). About 90% of the content of the new book came from the contents of
    four chapters of the first book with some rearrangement. It is said that when
    Suanfa Tongzong was first published, it sold so many copies that the cost of paper
    went up and the lucrative sales resulted in unscrupulous people beginning to print
    pirated copies of the book with many errors. it was this that forced the author
    to print an abridged version. [Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic] "Gollum" details
    how a three-week commission for Andy Serkis to provide a voice-over for Gollum
    grew into a five-year commitment to breathe life and soul into "The Lord of the

    the book, including character conception (Gollum’s "cough" is derived from his
    cat coughing up a hairball) as well as the hard work it took to act out Gollum
    and replace it with CGI. He also discusses the controversy of whether he should
    have been eligible for an Academy Award for his work as Gollum. [Sega All Stars]
    Sega All Stars was Sega’s budget series for the Dreamcast, similar to Platinum
    Hits, Greatest Hits, and Player’s Choice, for games that have sold many copies.
    When a title became a Sega All Stars title, it was sold at a lower price ($19.95)
    and given reprinted labeling. Sega All Stars was exclusive to North America, game
    covers were given an orange bar (as opposed to Europe’s blue color scheme) with
    the brand name written from top to bottom. The disc labels were also changed to
    include a small circle and the Sega All Stars brand printed inside of it. 17 titles
    were made into Sega All Stars titles. Also, in printing, original releases said
    "Sega Dreamcast" on the disc but the All-stars versions just simply said "Dreamcast"
    to match up games released with the black label like "D2", "Jet Set Radio", "Sega
    GT", and "Sonic Adventure 2". Original Dreamcast games were released in the white
    labels and said "Sega Dreamcast" on the inlay like the Sega All-stars labels.
    [Ingerophrynus] Ingerophrynus is a genus of true toads with 12 species. These
    species distributed in southern Yunnan and Indochina; peninsular Thailand and
    Malaya to Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Nias Island, Sulawesi, and the Philippines. This
    genus was established after a major taxonomical revision of frogs. Ten of the
    species in this genus were formerly considered species of the genus "Bufo". In
    2007 a new species, "Ingerophrynus gollum", was added to this genus. This species
    is named after the character Gollum created by J. R. R. Tolkien. [Cosmological
    interpretation of quantum mechanics] The cosmological interpretation of quantum
    mechanics, proposed by Anthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark, is an interpretation of
    quantum mechanics that applies in the context of eternal cosmological inflation,
    which arguably predicts an infinite three-dimensional space with infinitely many
    planets and infinitely many copies of any quantum system. According to this interpretation,
    the wavefunction for a quantum system describes not some imaginary ensemble of
    possibilities for what the system might be doing, but rather the actual spatial
    collection of identical copies of the system that exist in our infinite space.
    Its collapse can be avoided. Moreover, the quantum uncertainty that you experience
    simply reflects your inability to self-locate in space, i.e., to know which of
    your infinitely many copies throughout space is the one having your subjective
    perceptions. Based on the given context above, answer the question: The Ingerophrynus

    "Bolesław I Wielki" ), was Duke of Poland from 992 to 1025, and the first King
    of Poland in 1025\. As Boleslav IV, he was also Duke of Bohemia between 1002 and
    1003\. He was the son of Mieszko I of Poland by his wife, Dobrawa of Bohemia.
    According to a scholarly theory, Bolesław ruled Lesser Poland already during the
    last years of his father’s reign. Mieszko I, who died in 992, divided Poland among
    his sons, but Bolesław expelled his father’s last wife, Oda of Haldensleben, and
    his half-brothers and reunited Poland between 992 and 995\. [Frederick III, German
    Emperor] Frederick III (German: "Friedrich" ; 18 October 1831 – 15 June 1888)
    was German Emperor and King of Prussia for ninety-nine days in 1888, the Year
    of the Three Emperors. Friedrich Wilhelm Nikolaus Karl, known informally as "Fritz",
    was the only son of Emperor Wilhelm I and was raised in his family’s tradition
    of military service. Although celebrated as a young man for his leadership and
    successes during the Second Schleswig, Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars,
    he nevertheless professed a hatred of warfare and was praised by friends and enemies
    alike for his humane conduct. Following the unification of Germany in 1871 his
    father, then King of Prussia, became the German Emperor. Upon Wilhelm’s death
    at the age of ninety on 9 March 1888, the thrones passed to Frederick, who had
    by then been German Crown Prince for seventeen years and Crown Prince of Prussia
    for twenty-seven years. Frederick was suffering from cancer of the larynx when
    he died on 15 June 1888, aged fifty-six, following unsuccessful medical treatments
    for his condition. [Gothard Wilhelm Butler] Gothard Wilhelm Butler (German: "Gotthard
    Wilhelm von Buttlar" , c. 1600 – January 18, 1660) was a Polish-Lithuanian nobleman
    and politician of Scottish origin, born in Kuldīga (Goldingen). He was Grand treasurer
    of the Crown, the Crown court chamberlain and a captain of the guard of King John
    II Casimir Vasa and erderman of Prienai, Parnu and Bolesław. [Cardell Butler]
    Cardell Butler (born April 28, 1981 in San Francisco, California), also known
    as "Ballaholic," is an American streetball player. He is known for his appearances
    on the AND1 Mixtape Tour shows, which aired on ESPN. In conventional basketball,
    Butler has also played for the San Diego Wildcats of the American Basketball Association.
    He is 6-foot 4-inches tall, wears size 19 shoes, and plays the guard position.
    Butler is known for his aggressive scoring ability. When he was 15, Butler received
    his nickname, "Ballaholic", because he earned a reputation on the basketball court
    of always shooting the ball whenever he gained possession of it. Butler now plays
    for the San Francisco Rumble of the American Basketball Association. [George Aitken
    (rugby union)] George Gothard Aitken (2 July 1898 – 8 July 1952) was a rugby union
    footballer who represented New Zealand – known as the All Blacks – and then Scotland.
    He was born in Westport, New Zealand, and was selected to play provincially for
    Buller at the age of 16\. After moving to Wellington, Aitken played for the province
    from 1917, and from there was selected for the All Blacks side that faced South
    Africa when they toured New Zealand in 1921\. After only two Test matches for
    the All Blacks, both as captain, he was dropped from the team. In 1922 Aitken
    was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and travelled to England to study at the University
    of Oxford. He played for the university’s rugby club, and from there he was selected
    for Scotland. He first represented the country in 1924, and in 1925 appeared in
    all of their Five Nations matches; Scotland won all four of those games, and in
    doing so achieved their first ever Grand Slam. [Władysław II Jagiełło] Jogaila,
    later Władysław II Jagiełło (] ) (c. 1352/1362 – 1 June 1434) was the Grand Duke
    of Lithuania (1377–1434) and then the King of Poland (1386–1434), first alongside
    his wife Jadwiga until 1399, and then sole King of Poland. He ruled in Lithuania
    from 1377\. Born a pagan, in 1386 he converted to Catholicism and was baptized
    as Władysław in Kraków, married the young Queen Jadwiga, and was crowned King
    of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło. In 1387 he converted Lithuania to Christianity.
    His own reign in Poland started in 1399, upon the death of Queen Jadwiga, and
    lasted a further thirty-five years and laid the foundation for the centuries-long
    Polish–Lithuanian union. Based on the given context above, answer the question:

    The Fortean Society was started in the United States in 1931 during a meeting
    held in the New York flat of Charles Hoy Fort in order to promote the ideas of
    American writer Charles Fort. The Fortean Society was primarily based in New York
    City. Its first president was Theodore Dreiser, an old friend of Charles Fort,
    who had helped to get his work published. Founding members of The Fortean Society
    included Tiffany Thayer, Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Alexander Woollcott (and
    many of NYC’s literati such as Dorothy Parker), and Baltimore writer H. L. Mencken.
    Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd
    Wright and Buckminster Fuller. The first 6 issues of the Fortean Society’s newsletter
    "Doubt" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser.
    Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues. Thayer began
    to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with
    articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter,
    reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society’s direction,
    and forbidding them to use the name Fortean. During World War II, for example,
    Thayer used every issue of "Doubt" to espouse his politics. Particularly, he frequently
    expressed opposition to Civil Defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers
    to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens. In contrast to the spirit
    of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed
    the atomic bomb as a hoax. Based on the given context above, answer the question:

    in the Old Northwest that began to form in the early 19th century around the teaching
    of Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The confederation grew over several years and came
    to include several thousand warriors. Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the brother of

    the final battle of the Northwest Indian War, a struggle between Native American
    tribes affiliated with the Western Confederacy, including support from the British
    led by Captain Alexander McKillop, against the United States for control of the
    Northwest Territory (an area north of the Ohio River, east of the Mississippi
    River, and southwest of the Great Lakes). This land had been ceded to the United
    States in accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1783), but the Native Americans
    (who had not been party to the treaty) refused to comply with the treaty and relinquish
    control. British army bases were maintained there to support their Native allies.
    This ultimately led to the American offensive and subsequent British-Indian withdrawal
    from the territory altogether following the Treaty of Greenville. The battle,
    which was a decisive victory for the United States, ended major hostilities in
    the region until Tecumseh’s War and the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811\. [Tecumseh]
    Native American Shawnee warrior and chief, who became the primary leader of a
    large, multi-tribal confederacy in the early years of the nineteenth century.
    Born in the Ohio Country (present-day Ohio), and growing up during the American
    Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War, Tecumseh was exposed to warfare
    and envisioned the establishment of an independent Indian nation east of the Mississippi
    River under British protection and worked to recruit additional members to his
    tribal confederacy from the southern United States. [Tenskwatawa] Tenskwatawa
    (also called Tenskatawa, Tenskwatawah, Tensquatawa or Lalawethika) (January 1775
    – November 1836) was a Native American religious and political leader of the Shawnee
    tribe, known as the Prophet or the Shawnee Prophet. He was a younger brother of
    Tecumseh, leader of the Shawnee. Based on the given context above, answer the
    question: In what century did this Native warrior and chief, whose brother Tenskwatawa
    led the Tippecanoe order of battle, become the primary leader of a large, multi
    tribal confederacy? | The Native warrior and chief referred to in the context
    is Tecumseh, who became the primary leader of a large, multi-tribal confederacy
    in the early years of the nineteenth century. Therefore, Tecumseh became the primary
    leader of the confederacy in the 19th century. | Based on the given context, the
    Native warrior and chief, Tecumseh, became the primary leader of a large, multi-tribal
    confederacy in the early 19th century. | The Native warrior and chief whose brother
    Tenskwatawa led the Tippecanoe order of battle is Tecumseh. He became the primary

    Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), the first Proprietary Governor of the Province (colony)
    of Maryland. It is the only Maryland county that is part of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington,
    PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area [Arthur Aston] Sir Arthur Aston (died
    1627) was appointed Proprietary Governor of Avalon in 1625 by Sir George Calvert,
    (1579-1632), former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to King James I of
    England (and earlier James VI of Scotland), (later titled first Baron and Lord
    Baltimore in Ireland and received charter from King Charles I of the Kingdom of
    England in 1632 just before his death to found colonial Province of Maryland further
    south along Chesapeake Bay in future United States of America, carried out in
    1634 by his eldest son/heir Cecilius Calvert, second Baron and Lord Baltimore,
    [1605-1675], and nephew Leonard Calvert, [1606-1647], first provincial Governor
    of Maryland). Aston was a devout Roman Catholic and was recommended by Father
    Stout to govern the Catholic colony. Aston arrived in Ferryland, Avalon’s capital,
    around 1626 but returned to England the next year to resign his position and join
    the forces of the George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham in France, where he
    died the same year. [Maryland Day] Maryland Day is a legal holiday in the U.S.
    state of Maryland. It is observed on the anniversary of the March 25, 1634, landing
    of the first European settlers in the Province of Maryland, the third English
    colony to be settled in British North America. On this day settlers from ""The
    Ark"" and the smaller ""The Dove"" first stepped foot onto Maryland soil, at St.
    Clement’s Island in the Potomac River. The settlers were about 150 in number,
    departed from Gravesend on the Thames River downstream from London. Three Jesuit
    priests were collected from Cowes on the Isle of Wight in England where they avoided
    having to give the oath of allegiance and supremacy to the King. The colony’s
    grant was renewed to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, (1605-1675), two years
    prior by Charles I of England, after first being given to his father Sir George
    Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (1574-1632), along with the title of "Lord Baltimore",
    and a first grant in Acadia, in Newfoundland, (modern Canada), (title named after
    lands and town Baltimore, in Ireland) who had served the King in many official
    and personal capacities as Secretary of State, 1619-1625 (despite his conversion
    to Roman Catholicism). In thanksgiving for the safe landing, Jesuit Father Andrew
    White celebrated the Mass for the colonists led by the younger brother of Lord
    Baltimore, Leonard Calvert, (1606-1647), who served as the first governor, and
    perhaps for the first time ever in this part of the world on the first landing
    at Blackistone Island, later known as St. Clement’s Island off the northern shore
    of the Potomac River, which was the new border between the new colony and the
    earlier English settlements in Virginia) and erected a large cross. The landing
    coincided with the Feast of the Annunciation, a holy day honoring Mary, and the
    start of the new year in England’s legal calendar (prior to 1752). Maryland Day
    on 25 March celebrates the 1634 landing at St Clements. Later the colonists and
    their two ships sailed further back down river to the southeast to settle a capital
    at St. Mary’s City near the point where the Potomac flows into the Chesapeake
    Bay. [Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore] Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (8
    August 1605 – 30 November 1675), was the first Proprietor and Proprietary Governor
    of the Province of Maryland, and ninth Proprietary Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland
    and second of the colony of Province of Avalon to its southeast. His title was
    "Cecil Calvert, Second Baron Baltimore, First Lord Proprietary, Earl Palatine
    of the Provinces of Maryland and Avalon in America". He received the proprietorship
    after the death of his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (1579 – 15
    April 1632), for whom it had been intended. Cecil Calvert established and managed
    the Province of Maryland from his home, Kiplin Hall, in North Yorkshire, England.
    As an English Roman Catholic, he continued the legacy of his father by promoting
    religious tolerance in the colony. [Worcester County, Maryland] Worcester County

    via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he
    has given more than a thousand times. The idea to document his efforts came from
    producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global
    warming, which coincided with the opening of "The Day After Tomorrow". Laurie
    David was so inspired by Gore’s slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender,

    The Missouri Photo Workshop is an annual week-long photojournalism school based

    Founded in 1949 by the "Father of Photojournalism" Cliff Edom along with American
    economist, federal government official, and photographer Roy Stryker and photographer
    Russell Lee, the workshop originally sought to instruct others in photojournalism
    based on the "gritty, content-rich photographs" produced by the pre-World War
    II (pre-1939) Farm Security Administration, a United States government effort
    during the Great Depression to combat American rural poverty. Following Edom’s
    credo - "Show truth with a camera. Ideally truth is a matter of personal integrity.
    In no circumstances will a posed or faked photograph be tolerated." - each workshop
    originates in a different small town in Missouri, which is used as a backdrop
    for attendees from the United States and other countries to work on photograph
    storytelling methods such as research, observation, and timing. Missouri Photo

    at the University of Washington and for holding multiple design awards. His designs
    call to mind the current trend of being one with and improving the environment.
    Although Al Gore’s "An Inconvenient Truth" is after Richard Haag’s heyday, the
    ideals evoked from the film are shown in his designs. The social movement that
    created the hybrid car also demanded sustainable design, and Richard Haag provided
    it in the most distinctive and astounding ways. Richard Haag’s modernist and minimalist
    ideals set the tone for northwestern landscape design and has placed the northwest
