- en: Prompt leakage in large language models (LLMs) poses a significant security
    and privacy threat, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.
    However, leakage in multi-turn LLM interactions along with mitigation strategies
    has not been studied in a standardized manner. This paper investigates LLM vulnerabilities
    against prompt leakage across 4 diverse domains and 10 closed- and open-source
    LLMs. Our unique multi-turn threat model leverages the LLM’s *sycophancy* effect
    and our analysis dissects task instruction and knowledge leakage in the LLM response.
    In a multi-turn setting, our threat model elevates the average attack success
    rate (ASR) to 86.2%, including a 99% leakage with GPT-4 and claude-1.3\. We find
    that some black-box LLMs like Gemini show variable susceptibility to leakage across
    domains - they are more likely to leak contextual knowledge in the news domain
    compared to the medical domain. Our experiments measure specific effects of 6
    black-box defense strategies, including a *query-rewriter* in the RAG scenario.
    Our proposed multi-tier combination of defenses still has an ASR of 5.3% for black-box
    LLMs, indicating room for enhancement and future direction for LLM security research ¹¹1Our
    code and benchmark will be released soon for reproducibility.

- en: Prompt leakage is an injection attack against LLMs with the objective of revealing
    sensitive information from the LLM prompt (Perez & Ribeiro, [2022](#bib.bib20);
    Carlini et al., [2021](#bib.bib2); Zhang et al., [2024a](#bib.bib34)). Real-world
    LLM-integrated applications have been shown to be vulnerable to carefully crafted
    prompt leakage attacks (Yang et al., [2024](#bib.bib30); Sha & Zhang, [2024](#bib.bib23);
    Greshake et al., [2023](#bib.bib5)) mainly because their safety training conflicts
    with the instruction following objective (Zhang et al., [2023](#bib.bib36)). Vulnerability
    to prompt leakage can lead to the exposure of system IP to a malicious entity,
    including the task instructions, sensitive contextual knowledge prepended in the
    prompt (Geiping et al., [2024](#bib.bib4)), as well as style/format guidelines
    causing reputational harm and data theft. For agent-based Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation (RAG) systems, a highly practical scenario in LLM applications, prompt
    leakage may further expose backend API calls and system architecture to an adversary,
    compounding security risks (Wu et al., [2024](#bib.bib28)).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prior work has studied the leakage of prompt instructions across black-box and
    open source LLMs, on a variety of task prompts (Zhang et al., [2024a](#bib.bib34)).
    Contemporaneous work by  Qi et al. ([2024](#bib.bib21)) and Zeng et al. ([2024](#bib.bib32))
    have focused on specific aspects like datastore leakage and privacy leakage in
    RAG systems through designing adversarial prompts. They find that larger models
    are more susceptible to prompt leakage owing to better instruction following.
    The effectiveness and the simplicity of this threat, coupled with the ubiquity
    of LLM integrated applications raises important research questions. Firstly, defense
    strategies for mitigating the leakage effect in LLMs have been underexplored.
    Moreover, previous studies have focused only on leakage within a single turn attack.
    Common aspects of LLM applications, such as multi-turn interactions and other
    layers in a RAG scenario, such as a *query-rewriter*, has not been studied in
    the context of prompt leakage. Our experiments in this study extend the understanding
    of prompt leakage effect on a simulated RAG setup.

- en: In this paper, we simulate a standardized RAG setup to study the leakage mitigation
    effect of different black-box defense strategies. Our RAG setup involves a QA
    task with multi-turn interactions, and allows systematically evaluating leakage
    across 4 realistic domains - news, medical, legal and finance. We dissect LLM
    prompts into task instructions and domain-specific knowledge, to observe leakage
    of specific prompt contents. We conduct experiments on 7 black-box LLMs and 3
    open-source models behind our task setup.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To adapt to our multi-turn RAG setup, we employ a unique threat model. In turn
    1 we prompt the RAG setup with a domain-specific query, along with an attack prompt.
    Subsequently, in turn 2 of the same conversation we send a challenger utterance
    for a successive leakage attempt. Prior work has shown that sycophantic behavior
    in models (Laban et al., [2023](#bib.bib14); Sharma et al., [2023](#bib.bib24))
    can have rather universal effects in degrading model quality on various tasks.
    We apply a similar methodology in turn 2 of our threat model and find that our
    sycophancy challenger increases the average ASR from 17.7% to 86.6%, effecting
    99.9% leakage on gpt-4 and claude-1.3. We find that some black-box LLMs show domain-specific
    variability for prompt leakage - they are less likely to leak information in a
    RAG setup for the medical or legal domain, versus the news domain.

    techniques, which assume no access to model parameters. Amongst the black-box
    mitigation techniques assessed independently, we find that Structured outputs
    defense is the most effective at reducing average ASR at turn 1 and Instruction
    dnefense at the turn 2 leakage attempt. We study the efficacy of a query-rewriting
    layer in our RAG setup, and propose a multi-tier defense in combination with black-box
    defenses. Applying all mitigation strategies together in our RAG setup brings
    the ASR close to 0% for some models, but overall still leads to an 5.3% average
    ASR for black-box LLMs against our threat model.

    guidance to an LLM, and can defend against adversarial attacks (Yi et al., [2023](#bib.bib31)).
    In our task setup, the in-context examples are themselves vulnerable to leakage.
    Since the in-context examples are sensitive and domain-specific, they contribute
    towards knowledge leakage when determining attack success. (2) Instruction defense
    We augment the instructions in the original prompt to treat its contents as sensitive
    and refuse leakage attempts. Prior work has shown the efficacy of safety instructions
    in defending LLMs from unsafe prompts (Varshney et al., [2023](#bib.bib27)). (3)
    Multi-turn dialogue Prior work has shown that separating the user input (containing
    the attack prompt) from the task instructions in a different conversation turn
    acts as a form of defense (Yi et al., [2023](#bib.bib31)). We call all model APIs
    as follows: 1\. user specifies the task instructions (INSTR), 2\. assistant asks
    for the query to be answered, 3\. user (adversary) provides the input, which is
    sent to the LLM along with the domain-specific knowledge documents (KD). (4) XML
    tagging Surrounding different sections of the LLM prompt using XML tags creates
    boundary awareness, and may assist the LLM in separating the task instructions
    from the user input (Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib17)). (5) Sandwich defense If
    the user input is sandwiched between prompt instructions, it may render the appended
    attack prompt less effective (Liu et al., [2023](#bib.bib17)). We divide the task
    instructions into system role and task guidelines, and sandwich the user input
    between them. (6) Combined defense We apply above 5 black-box defenses together
    to our simulated RAG setup. (7) Structured outputs We prompt our RAG setup to
    generate responses in a specific JSON format for both conversation turns, which
    constrains the LLM output towards relevant content. Since this may be implemented
    through LLM function calling ⁵⁵5https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling,
    a practical scenario for RAG systems, we study this setting separately.'

    Liu & Mozafari, [2024](#bib.bib16)) which applies a transformation to the user
    provided input before performing the QA task with an LLM. This practical scenario,
    motivated towards sanitizing and standardizing the user input, adds a layer of
    defense in RAG systems. We use a cheaper LLM as a fixed query-rewriter, and prompt
    it to ground the input text in the domain and expand the query if required (Table [15](#A1.T15
    "Table 15 ‣ A.6 Query Rewriter prompt and responses ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Investigating

    turn 2 first pass through the query-rewriter before performing the QA task.

    success on turn 2 increases manifold with an added *reiteration* prompt to 10% more than the threat

    factors like embedding models similarity metrics to consider. We instead simulate
    a retriever in our study to focus on the multi-turn threat model and examine fine-grained
    leakage. We leave exploring prompt leakage in different RAG configurations for
    future work. Secondly, the RAG setup described in this paper, although generic
    and extensible, is simple - we only simulate a 2-step LLM interaction in our study
    along with our threat model. We study only black-box defense in the context of
    prompt leakage (inexhaustive), but future work should explore the effect of instruction
    finetuning specifically for mitigating prompt leakage. Lastly, leakage detection
    and response labeling are challenging tasks that have not been studied in depth.
    Since our rouge-based detection method has lower precision in turn 1 (Table [2](#S4.T2
    "Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Leakage Detection ‣ 4 Threat Model ‣ Investigating the prompt leakage
    effect and black-box defenses for multi-turn LLM interactions")), it likely underestimates
    the extent of leakage. We leave an exploration of leakage detection techniques
    for future work .

- en: We perform a comprehensive set of experiments for prompt leakage with a standardize
    task setup, against a unique multi-turn threat model. Our study systematically
    measures prompt leakage behind a simulated multi-turn RAG scenario. We leverage
    the LLM *sycophancy* behaviour in our threat model, and show that it makes both
    closed- and open-source models more susceptible to prompt leakage. We encourage
    further research in exploiting this as a security vulnerability as well as defensive
    measures. We observe how leakage rate in RAG systems can vary with the combination
    of the domain and LLM, as well as present fine-grained analysis of prompt content
    leakage. We assess a combination of black-box defenses for mitigating the leakage
    effect, and show that a multi-tier defense with query-rewriting reduces avg ASR
    significantly for closed- source models, while open-source models are still susceptible
    to prompt leakage attacks.

    leakage attempt to reveal the prompt instructions (INSTR), without a domain-specific
    query for retrieval. The user input in turn 1 is directly the attack prompt while
    the turn 2 challenger remains the same. We simplify our prompt template in Table [1](#S4.T1
    "Table 1 ‣ 4 Threat Model ‣ Investigating the prompt leakage effect and black-box
    defenses for multi-turn LLM interactions"), assuming no-domain specific retrieval
    and slightly modifying the instruction in the attack prompts.

    effect and black-box defenses for multi-turn LLM interactions"), we compare leakage
    success in our baseline setting v/s INSTR leakage in the direct attack scenario.
    We observe that in turn 1, most models are more likely to leak information in
    a direct attack. Only a few models such as gemini-1.0-pro, gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4
    show higher INSTR leakage in turn 1 of the baseline, compared to the direct attack
    scenario. This is likely due to safety detectors for these model APIs, which the
    task-assisted attack prompt can bypass.
