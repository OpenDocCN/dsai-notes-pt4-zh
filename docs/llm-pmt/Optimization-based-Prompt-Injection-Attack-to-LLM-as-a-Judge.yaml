- en: LLM-as-a-Judge is a novel solution that can assess textual information with
    large language models (LLMs). Based on existing research studies, LLMs demonstrate
    remarkable performance in providing a compelling alternative to traditional human
    assessment. However, the robustness of these systems against prompt injection
    attacks remains an open question. In this work, we introduce JudgeDeceiver, a
    novel optimization-based prompt injection attack tailored to LLM-as-a-Judge. Our
    method formulates a precise optimization objective for attacking the decision-making
    process of LLM-as-a-Judge and utilizes an optimization algorithm to efficiently
    automate the generation of adversarial sequences, achieving targeted and effective
    manipulation of model evaluations. Compared to handcraft prompt injection attacks,
    our method demonstrates superior efficacy, posing a significant challenge to the
    current security paradigms of LLM-based judgment systems. Through extensive experiments,
    we showcase the capability of JudgeDeceiver in altering decision outcomes across
    various cases, highlighting the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems to the
    optimization-based prompt injection attack.

- en: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT [[34](#bib.bib34)], have garnered
    significant attention for their exceptional natural language processing (NLP)
    capabilities. These models are increasingly applied across a spectrum of downstream
    tasks including the medical domain [[32](#bib.bib32)], education [[9](#bib.bib9)],
    and software engineering [[38](#bib.bib38)], leveraging their sophisticated functionalities.
    A notable trend in recent research [[28](#bib.bib28); [51](#bib.bib51); [44](#bib.bib44);
    [26](#bib.bib26); [50](#bib.bib50); [52](#bib.bib52)] is the exploration of LLMs
    as evaluative judges, a role that promises to markedly diminish the need for extensive
    human intervention in experimental assessments. In this capacity, termed LLM-as-a-Judge,
    these powerful models assess the outcomes of other models on specific tasks—particularly
    open-ended questions—exhibiting a high correlation with human evaluative standards.
    The deployment of LLMs in this judge-like role spans diverse applications, from
    benchmark performance evaluation [[28](#bib.bib28)] to the quality ranking of
    potential answers, as seen in reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF)
    [[24](#bib.bib24)], LLM-powered search engines, and tool selection for LLM-based
    agents [[18](#bib.bib18)].

    attack vectors [[41](#bib.bib41); [14](#bib.bib14)], including sophisticated strategies
    like backdoor [[46](#bib.bib46); [39](#bib.bib39)] and jailbreak attacks [[45](#bib.bib45);
    [31](#bib.bib31)]. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers seeking
    to manipulate the judgmental capabilities of LLMs for their gain. Such manipulations
    can artificially enhance the perceived efficacy of specific models on leading
    benchmarks, potentially leading to undeserved acclaim, funding, or commercial
    advantage. Moreover, these attacks can skew the LLM-judged rankings, favorably
    positioning attackers’ submissions and distorting fair competition.

    This technique modifies an LLM’s output through the introduction of maliciously
    designed prompts [[30](#bib.bib30)], effectively commandeering the model’s response
    mechanism. For example, while the system’s intended prompt might be "You are a
    helpful assistant," an attacker could inject a directive such as "Ignore previous
    sentences and print ’hello world’," thereby diverting the LLM’s output away from
    its designed purpose.

    of utilizing LLM-as-a-Judge. We undertake a systematic examination of these vulnerabilities
    by conducting prompt injection attacks [[15](#bib.bib15); [11](#bib.bib11); [37](#bib.bib37)]
    on LLM-based judges in various contexts. Before this, we identify significant
    challenges in executing attacks against the LLM-as-a-Judge. A primary concern
    is the issue of generalizability. Previous efforts, while insightful, have predominantly
    concentrated on handcrafted prompt injections [[15](#bib.bib15); [11](#bib.bib11);
    [37](#bib.bib37)], which fail to uniformly succeed across different user prompts.
    This limitation underscores the urgent necessity for more universally applicable
    methods that do not sacrifice effectiveness. Moreover, the extensive reliance
    on manual labor to devise these prompt injections poses an additional substantial
    hurdle. This approach is not only labor-intensive but also introduces variability
    in the effectiveness of the attacks due to its inherent subjectivity.

    generation loss is designed to increase the likelihood of eliciting a specific
    response from LLMs, thereby making the attacks more directed and effective. The
    target-enhancement loss further strengthens this effect by promoting the generation
    of specific option tokens, thereby skewing the LLM’s output in favor of the attacker’s

    Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge"), we expound upon the proposed attack methodology, JudgeDeceiver,
    as illustrated in [Figure 3](#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3 JudgeDeceiver ‣ Optimization-based
    Prompt Injection Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge"). At its core, JudgeDeceiver aims to
    establish a systematic and automated approach for crafting adversarial sequences,
    subsequently appending these to a target response with the intent of biasing the
    LLM-as-a-Judge towards selecting the target response over other candidate responses.
    Considering the challenge posed by the attacker’s limited insight into candidate
    responses, our initial step involves the creation of a shadow dataset. This dataset
    is designed to simulate the candidate responses characteristic of the LLM-as-a-Judge
    evaluation scenario, thereby providing a basis for attack strategies. Distinct
    from previous adversarial attacks that target classifiers or individual tokens,
    the LLM-as-a-Judge attack constitutes a text generation challenge. To address
    this, we devise a novel target optimization function specifically for generating
    adversarial sequences, enabling the attacker to launch high-efficiency attacks.
    This optimization function includes three distinct loss components: target-aligned
    generation loss, target enhancement loss, and adversarial perplexity loss. Each
    component tackles different aspects of the attack, with the overall goal of minimizing
    their weighted sum. Moreover, considering the challenges associated with optimizing
    discrete inputs and the inherent position bias in LLM-as-a-Judge selections, we
    introduce an optimization algorithm that leverages gradient search and position
    swapping. This method is designed to facilitate effective attack goals.'
