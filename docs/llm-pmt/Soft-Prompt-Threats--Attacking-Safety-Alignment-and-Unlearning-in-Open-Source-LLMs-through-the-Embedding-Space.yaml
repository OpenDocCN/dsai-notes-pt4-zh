  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input
    manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred
    to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression
    of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their
    safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source
    LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this
    research gap and propose embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous
    embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks
    circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than
    discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat
    model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract
    supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and
    models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat
    model in open-source LLMs.

    across various domains, including time-series processing (Ismail Fawaz et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib1); Nguyen et al., [2020](#bib.bib2)), AI for science (Gao and
    Günnemann, [2021](#bib.bib3); Kosmala et al., [2023](#bib.bib4)), business monitoring (Brown
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib5); Nguyen et al., [2021](#bib.bib6)), and trend analysis (Dumbach
    et al., [2023a](#bib.bib7), [b](#bib.bib8)). Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
    have extended from academia to widespread public use. With LLM-integrated applications
    getting increasingly prevalent, various methods have been proposed to enhance
    the safety of LLMs after deployment (Jain et al., [2023](#bib.bib9); Li et al.,
    [2023](#bib.bib10)). Despite these efforts, LLMs have remained vulnerable to exploitation
    by malicious actors (Deng et al., [2023](#bib.bib11); Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)).
    The majority of investigated threat models in the literature, such as prompt injection (Zou
    et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)) or jailbreaking (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib13)),
    operate on the discrete token level (Chao et al., [2023](#bib.bib13); Huang et al.,
    [2024](#bib.bib14)). This choice is influenced by the accessibility of LLM-integrated
    applications, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, [2023](#bib.bib15)), which are predominantly
    available through APIs limited to natural language input.

    on consumer hardware and do not require interaction with APIs (e.g., distributing
    dangerous information, promoting biases, or influencing elections). In the case
    of open-source models, an adversary has complete access to the weights and activations.
    As a result, the adversary is not limited to discrete manipulation of natural
    language tokens but can directly attack their continuous embedding space representation.

- en: While the experiments on the harmful behavior dataset demonstrate that embedding
    space attacks can trigger harmful responses in safety-aligned models, it is unclear
    if these attacks reduce the perplexity of the model. Additionally, the evaluation
    protocol in (Zou et al., [2023](#bib.bib12)) only considers if specific keywords
    are within the generated response, which can lead to increased false positive
    and false negative rates (Qi et al., [2023](#bib.bib28)). For a more nuanced evaluation,
    we calculate the perplexity and toxicity of generated answers with and without
    embedding attacks. For the toxicity evaluation, we generate toxicity scores between
    $0$ using the toxic-bert model (Hanu and Unitary team, [2020](#bib.bib26)). Nonetheless,
    the toxicity assessment of the toxic-bert model is limited to toxic text that
    contains explicit content. Subtle toxicity is often missed by the model in our
    experiment.

    Attacking Safety Alignment and Unlearning in Open-Source LLMs through the Embedding
    Space") shows boxplots of the perplexity and toxicity values of generated responses
    from different models using the instructions of the harmful behavior dataset as
    input. Perplexity is measured only on the generated response without the instruction
    attack or target. We compare the distribution of values when attacking and prompting
    the models without attack. Attacking the model does not lead to higher perplexity
    in our experiments. Surprisingly, all models exhibit lower perplexity values on
    responses generated under attack. This effect is most pronounced for the Mistral
    model, where the perplexity of the response is considerably smaller with the attack.
    Fine-tuning has less effect on the toxicity of the answers than embedding attacks.
    We find that filtering for responses that show low perplexity and high toxicity
    is an effective way to find probable harmful responses. Examples are given in
    Appendix [K](#A11 "Appendix K Examples of Harmful Behaviors ‣ Soft Prompt Threats:
