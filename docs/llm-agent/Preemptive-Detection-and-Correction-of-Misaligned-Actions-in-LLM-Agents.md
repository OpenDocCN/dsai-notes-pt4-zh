###### Abstract

Deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications often faces a critical challenge: the misalignment between agents’ behavior and user intent. Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute some critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a ‘buy-now’ in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents’ decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct’s effectiveness in improving agent alignment.

## 1 Introduction

The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spawned a variety of LLM-based agents capable of completing complex tasks such as navigating the web Zhou et al. ([2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib54)), managing databases Wang et al. ([2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib38)), and generating code Wang et al. ([2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib39)). These agents demonstrate strong capabilities in autonomously performing complex tasks Yao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib48)); Liu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib19)); Wu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib42)); Xie et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib43)); Fang et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib6)). Despite these advances, deploying such agents in real-world scenarios introduces significant challenges, particularly in environments where certain actions carry substantial consequences.

Figure 1: An example of our proposed preemptive evaluation workflow: The critical action clean taken by the Actor agent in a household task triggers the detector to evaluate whether the Actor agent is on track before execution. The detector alerts the human to intervene after it detects that the agent is most likely off track, avoiding any potential negative consequences.

A misexecution of those critical actions can lead to operational failures, erosion of user trust, or even irreversible outcomes. For instance, a web shopping agent might misinterpret user instructions and buy unwanted items, leading to monetary loss, or a household agent could mishandle kitchen equipment, causing unintended property damage.

Detecting and correcting such misaligned actions before execution is crucial for agents’ deployment in real-life applications. However, this aspect remains relatively underexplored. Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc reflection Shinn et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib31)); Yao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib49)); Zhou et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib53)); Kim et al. ([2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib14)), which analyze execution results retrospectively for future performance improvement. While these approaches enhance the capabilities of LLM agents, they fall short in situations where incorrect action execution may cause significant harm. Recognizing this gap, SeeAct Zheng et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib52)), a web agent, requires the human user to manually validate each action before execution to avoid potentially harmful consequences on real websites. While effective in preventing unintended errors, the manual inspection places an undue cognitive burden on users and limits the autonomy of LLM-based agents. This brings us to an important question:

how can we effectively detect and correct misaligned critical actions, without overburdening users or compromising agent autonomy?

In response to this challenge, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach for detecting the misalignment between the agent’s behavior and user intent. By mimicking the vigilance of a human overseer, InferAct observes the agent’s actions and infers its underlying intent. The ability to infer intent, known as belief reasoning in Theory of Mind (ToM) Premack and Woodruff ([1978](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib24)), enables humans to interpret others’ behavior by attributing mental states such as beliefs and intentions to them. The recent work Strachan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib34)) has shown that GPT-4 models performed at human levels in ToM tasks such as identifying indirect requests, and false beliefs. Building on such capabilities of LLMs, InferAct analyzes the intent behind action chains to verify it against user intent. If the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts humans to intervene, preventing adverse outcomes and refining the agent’s decision-making process (c.f. Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")). By incorporating human input, InferAct facilitates an iterative improvement loop, ensuring agents’ actions more closely align with user intent over time. To preserve the agent’s autonomy while avoiding the adverse consequences from misaligned critical actions, InferAct is triggered only when the agent attempts any pre-identified critical action with negative consequences.

To assess the effectiveness of InferAct, we evaluate its ability to detect misaligned actions and assist the user and agent in correcting them. We conduct experiments across three diverse environments: a web shopping task Yao et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib47)), a household task Shridhar et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib32)), and a search-based Question Answering task Yang et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib46)). Our results , demonstrate that InferAct outperforms baselines in 8 out of 9 settings across various LLMs (e.g. GPT4-Turbo, GPT3.5-Turbo, and Llama-3-70B), achieving the improvement up to 20% on Macro-F1 score in detecting misaligned actions. When collaborating with the agent and the user, InferAct also enhances the correction of misaligned behaviors. It improves the success rate of the agent by a margin of 10.4% over the alternative methods with natural language feedback.

To summarize, our contributions are as follows:

*   •

    We propose a preemptive evaluation workflow for LLM-based agents involved in critical decision-making, employing a detector to detect misaligned actions before execution and alerting humans for intervention to enhance both reliability and performance.

*   •

    We introduce InferAct, a novel approach that applies belief reasoning, based on the Theory of Mind (ToM) of LLMs to assist humans in preemptively detecting misaligned actions. Our experiments show InferAct achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting misaligned actions on three tasks with different LLMs.

*   •

    We investigate collaboration among the detector, the Actor agent, and the human user, demonstrating that the Actor agent, guided by InferAct achieves the best performance compared with alternative methods.

## 2 Related Work

#### Trustworthiness of LLM Agents.

As LLM agents increasingly interact with various environments, mitigating risks from critical action misexecution and the need for human oversight is crucial but underexplored. Emulation methods, which assess risks by using LLMs as sandbox environments Ruan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib27)); Hua et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib11)). These methods depend heavily on the fidelity of the simulated environment, posing challenges in modeling complex real-world scenarios like web shopping (see Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A3 "Appendix C Related Work ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")). In contrast, InferAct evaluates real-time alignment between agent behavior and user goals, eliminating the need for simulations and enabling reliable execution of critical actions.

#### Evaluation and Feedback Acquisition of LLM Agents.

Prior research assumes feedback is either available post-execution Shinn et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib31)); Yao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib49)); Zhou et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib53)); Kim et al. ([2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib14)) or entirely unavailable Kim et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib13)); Song et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib33)); Zhao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib51)). However, post-execution feedback is often unavailable for actions with negative consequences in the real-world setting. Without the assumption of post-execution feedback, studies such as Co-learning Qian et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib25)), ExpeL Zhao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib51)), and ETO Song et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib33)) have explored feedback acquisition during offline learning (details in Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A3 "Appendix C Related Work ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")). Our work differs by focusing on real-time error detection and feedback acquisition during online operations. Unlike Pan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib23)), who focus on trajectory correctness via direct prompts (included in our baseline), we prioritize real-time misaligned action detection and correction to prevent negative consequences, enhancing the agent reliability and performance for real-life deployment.

#### Machine Theory-of-Mind.

ToM is a human cognitive ability to attribute mental states for behavior prediction Premack and Woodruff ([1978](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib24)). Recent studies Kosinski ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib15)); Bubeck et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib5)); Shapira et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib29)); Ullman ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib37)); Strachan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib34)) show GPT models exhibit promising results in some ToM capabilities (refer to Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A3 "Appendix C Related Work ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")). While most studies evaluate ToM capabilities, we preliminarily leverage such abilities to help humans detect misaligned behaviors in LLM agents.

## 3 Approach

In this section, we introduce our proposed method, InferAct, for misaligned action detection. Furthermore, we elaborate on the synergy between InferAct, the Actor agent, and the human user in correcting such misalignments.

### 3.1 InferAct

Inspired by belief reasoning, a core aspect of human Theory of Mind (ToM) Rubio-Fernández et al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib28)), InferAct infers the intent behind the agent’s behaviors. This cognitive ability allows humans to deduce others’ mental states, such as beliefs and intentions, based on observed actions, which facilitates effective communication and collaboration. Similarly, InferAct reasons about the beliefs underlying the agent’s actions and compares them with user instructions to identify misalignments. To achieve this, InferAct employs two key components: the Task Inference Unit and the Task Verification Unit (c.f. Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ The Task Inference Unit. ‣ 3.1 InferAct ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")). These components work in tandem to infer the agent’s intent and verify its alignment with the user’s intent, ensuring preemptive misalignment detection.

#### The Task Inference Unit.

This unit is designed for belief reasoning, aiming to deduce the intention of the Actor from its behaviors, i.e., a sequence of actions and corresponding observations, denoted as $S=\{a_{1},o_{1},...,a_{m},o_{m}\}$. Specifically, we instruct LLMs with prompt $P^{i}$ to observe $S$ and deduce the task $T^{\prime}$ interpreting the Actor’s behavior $S$.

|  | $T^{\prime}=LLM(P^{i},S)$ |  |

Once the task $T^{\prime}$ is obtained, we need to verify its alignment with the user’s task $T^{*}$ ¹¹1The user’s task $T^{*}$ is clear and unambiguous in our setup. Handling ambiguous instructions is a separate research topic beyond the scope of our study.. The verification is performed by the Task Verification Unit.

![Refer to caption](img/648a772ad90926527fa63b6ee9f6f827.png)

Figure 3: The workflow and components of InferAct.

#### The Task Verification Unit.

Given the agent’s behavior $S$, the inferred task $T^{\prime}$, and the actual task $T^{*}$, we need to identify the alignment between $T^{\prime}$ and $T^{*}$. Such verification can be triggered either at the end of the task (completion evaluation) or during the process (progress evaluation). If the action under evaluation is a terminal action (e.g. ‘buy-now’ in web shopping), we perform the completion evaluation with prompt $P^{c}$ to evaluate whether completing $T^{\prime}$ entails that the user’s task $T^{*}$ is also fulfilled:

|  | $Y^{c}=LLM(P^{c},S,T^{*},T^{\prime})$ |  |

where $Y^{c}\in\{True,False\}$, indicating whether $T^{\prime}$ entails $T^{*}$. In this context, we employ one-way entailment, which is more suitable than bi-directional entailment. For instance, an action chain $S$ that fulfills the fine-grained task (e.g. buy a grey vanity bench with metal legs) entails fulfilling a more general, coarse-grained instruction (e.g., buy a vanity bench) but not vice versa.
If the action under evaluation could occur either midway or at the end, we first perform completion evaluation as for the terminal action. If $Y^{c}$ is $True$, no further evaluation is needed, as it indicates alignment. If $Y^{c}$ is $False$, this indicates that $T^{\prime}$ is either misaligned or in the middle of the process. In such cases, we proceed to a progress evaluation with prompt $P^{p}$ to assess whether $T^{\prime}$ progress correctly towards completing the user’s task $T^{*}$:

|  | $Y^{p}=LLM(P^{p},S,T^{*},T^{\prime})$ |  |

where $Y^{p}\in\{True,False\}$ indicates whether $T^{\prime}$ is on the right track towards completing $T^{*}$.
InferAct is a generic framework that can be adapted to different tasks. We provide the prompts $P^{i}$, $P^{c}$ and $P^{p}$ used in our experiments in Appendix [A.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A1.SS1 "A.1 Prompts Used for Different Methods ‣ Appendix A Prompts Used in Experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents").

### 3.2 Synergy between InferAct, Actor and the User

We illustrate how InferAct, the Actor agent, and the user collaborate to detect and correct the misaligned actions, thereby preventing adverse effects and enhancing the agent’s performance. Since the Actor agent needs to explore the environments to complete tasks, scrutinizing every action it takes will impose significant computation overhead and restrict its autonomy. Therefore, we first identify a set of critical actions $\mathcal{A}$ that carry substantial consequences in operating environments. InferAct serves as a guardrail for these critical actions, which is only triggered when the agent attempts an action $\mathrm{a}\in\mathcal{A}$. When the agent’s behavior is flagged by InferAct, the user is alerted to make the final judgment and provide feedback to the agent for correction. Regarding the forms of feedback, in Section [5.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.SS3 "5.3 Collaborative Dynamics Between InferAct, Actor, and the User ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), we explore two types: binary and natural-language feedback. In this collaboration paradigm, InferAct works as a proxy for the human user, detecting misalignments and issuing alertness. This reduces the user’s oversight burden while enhancing the agent’s performance without incurring the cost of failure.

## 4 Experimental Setup

### 4.1 Tasks

We evaluate our approach on three commonly used LLM agent benchmarks: WebShop Yao et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib47)), HotPotQA Yang et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib46)), and ALFWorld Shridhar et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib32)). These benchmarks mirror the complexities of real-world scenarios and provide interactive environments, enabling us to thoroughly analyze the collaboration among the detector, user, and agent over iterations. To avoid omission, we manually identify critical actions carrying negative consequences in these benchmarks.

#### WebShop

is an online shopping benchmark where an agent needs to fulfill user requests, such as purchasing a white vanity bench under $50. Actions include search and click through the website, with the critical action being the terminal action click[Buy Now] due to its financial implications.

#### HotPotQA.

In the agent setup Yao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib48)), the agent is required to find the answer using actions like search[entity], lookup[string] and finish[answer]. The critical action is finish[answer] as it often affects the user’s satisfaction with the system, e.g., in the context of customer service.

#### ALFWorld

involves household tasks such as Pick & Place, Clean & Place, Heat & Place, Cool & Place. We include Clean, Heat, Cool as critical actions as they can potentially cause irreversible physical state changes to the objects. These actions can happen either in the progress or at the end of a task. The task completion is also included.
Please refer to Appendix [E](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A5 "Appendix E Task Description ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") for details and data size.

### 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of different detectors comprehensively, we employ four different metrics. (1) Marco-F1 score: This metric measures the F1-score across both positive class (misalignment detection) and negative class (agent usability), providing a balanced view of effectiveness. (2) Cost: This metric considers the cost of both false negatives (undetected misalignment) and false positives (false alarms). However, translating associated consequences into quantitative costs is challenging and typically requires input from domain experts in different tasks. Here, we simply quantify the cost incurred by different methods as the total number of false negatives and false positives. (3) Effective Reliability (ER) Whitehead et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib41)): $\frac{TP-FP}{TP+FP}$ where TP represents true positives and FP represents false positives, respectively. This metric measures the reliability of the detected misaligned actions, i.e., how many more true positives there are compared to false positives. (4) PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve): A classifier can be conservative or liberal by tuning thresholds. By considering all possible thresholds, PR-AUC provides a more comprehensive understanding of the detection ability of detectors, regardless of the specific threshold chosen. Further evaluation of the synergy between detectors, the agent, the user is elaborated in section [5.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.SS3 "5.3 Collaborative Dynamics Between InferAct, Actor, and the User ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents").

### 4.3 Baselines and Backbone LLMs

As there is no previous work on fine-tuned evaluators in these tasks, we transform existing prompting approaches into the LLM-based agent scenario. All prompts are available in Appendix [A.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A1.SS1 "A.1 Prompts Used for Different Methods ‣ Appendix A Prompts Used in Experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents").

#### Direct Prompt.

This method directly prompts LLMs to output Correct or Incorrect for the trajectory. This method has been widely used such as self-refinement Madaan et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib21)), the evaluator for web agents Pan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib23)), and Prospector Kim et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib13)). LLMs should alert humans when the output is Incorrect.

#### Self-Consistency.

Based on the direct prompt, self-consistency Wang et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib40)) evaluates the reasoning trajectory $m$ times and leverages the majority voting as the final evaluation. The sampling time $m$ is set to five in our experiments.

#### Token Probability.

Previous study Kadavath et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib12)) shows that LLMs are well-calibrated on multiple choice and true/false questions when provided in the right format. We adopt the format and ask LLM to answer Is the proposed reasoning trajectory: A. True B. False. The probability $p$ of B. False is used to indicate alertness. The threshold $p^{*}$ is determined by maximizing the Macro-F1 score on the development set. During the inference, when $p>p^{*}$, the LLM will alert the human.

#### Token Entropy.

Entropy is often used to measure the uncertainty of predictions in classification tasks Sun et al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib35)); Malinin and Gales ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib22)). We calculate the entropy of the predicted probability $p=P(y=\text{Alert}\mid x)$: $H(p)=-p\log(p)-(1-p)\log(1-p)$. The threshold $H^{*}(p)$ is decided using a development set. When the $H(p)$ > $H^{*}(p)$, the LLM will flag the trajectory.

#### Multi-step Evaluation.

This approach evaluates the reasoning trajectory step-by-step. LLMs are prompted to generate a verbalized probability $P_{i}$ to estimate the correctness of each step $S_{i}$. The overall score is aggregated based on the step-level estimate. In our experiments, we compare the performance of four different aggregation methods $\{Min,Max,Mean,Product\}$, which shows that $Product$ achieves the best performance and the full results are reported in Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A4.T8 "Table 8 ‣ Appendix D Results for Multi-Step Evaluation ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents").

#### InferAct.

We adopt two variants: InferAct-verb which directly outputs True/False while InferAct-prob outputs the probability of True/False.
Regarding back-end LLMs, we use gpt-41106-preview Achiam et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib1)) as the Actor agent to perform the user’s task. For detectors, both commercial and open-sourced LLMs are adopted as the back-ends, including Llama-3 (70B) AI@Meta ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib2)), gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, and gpt-4-1106-preview. The implementation details of experiments can be found in Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2 "Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents").

Table 1: Performance of different methods across three tasks with different LLMs. Best results in bold and second best in underline. “-” indicates methods directly output binary labels and thus no PR-AUC. InferAct achieves the best overall performance in 8 out of 9 settings on the Marco-F1 score.

Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Overall Performance ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") shows the performance of different methods with three LLMs on three tasks.

#### InferAct achieves the best performance among all methods.

In 8 out of 9 settings (3 different tasks and 3 back-end LLMs), InferAct achieves the best performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by an average of 8% in the Macro-F1 score. In terms of the detection ability (PR-AUC of the positive class), InferAct outperforms the alternative methods in 7 out of 9 settings. Although InferAct-verb lags behind InferAct-prob a bit (0.624 vs 0.655), it is the best choice when no validation set is available for threshold tuning. Among different tasks, InferAct with Llama-3-70B works better than GPT4-Turbo in both Webshop and ALFWorld except from HotPotQA. An interesting observation is that GPT4-Turbo sometimes exhibits extra considerations that are not reflected in the task. For instance, in ALFWorld, for the task heat some apple and put it in fridge, although the Actor correctly completed it, GPT4-Turbo raises concerns about whether the apple needed to be prepared (e.g., sliced) before heating. Similarly, for the task of heating the cup in the microwave, GPT4-Turbo questions whether the cup contained a beverage that needed to be checked. This indicates the GPT4-Turbo possesses more nuanced real-world knowledge. Although its broader considerations result in more false positives under current task evaluation, they could be valuable in many real-world contexts when comprehensive considerations are required.

#### Multi-step outperforms Token Probability, followed by Token Entropy, Direct Prompt, and Self-Consistency.

On average, their Macro-F1 are 0.576, 0.563, 0.524, 0.485, 0.448\. In general, probability-based methods outperform direct prompting but they require additional development set for threshold tunning. Multi-step evaluation achieves the best performance among them, indicating that step-by-step evaluation is suited to agent scenarios. We find that the performance of self-consistency fluctuates among different models, showing its lack of robustness.

### 5.2 Analysis

#### Which model excels in Task Inference or Verification of InferAct?

In Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Overall Performance ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), we evaluate InferAct using a single model for both Task Inference and Verification. However, how do these abilities vary in different models? To investigate this, we mix different LLMs for each component and evaluate the Macro-F1 score of InferAct-verb. As shown in Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ Which model excels in Task Inference or Verification of InferAct? ‣ 5.2 Analysis ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), Llama-3-70B achieves the best average performance for both task inference (0.639) and task validation (0.648) across different tasks. For HotpotQA, GPT4-Turbo is the best in both inference and validation while Llama-3-70B shows superior performance in both ALFWorld and WebShop. We also find that cross-model combinations can often yield better performance than using a single model. For instance, combining GPT3.5-Turbo for Task Inference and GPT4-Turbo for Task verification achieves the highest performance (0.662) in HotpotQA. When pairing Llama-3-70B for task inference with GPT4-Turbo for task validation, the combination outperforms using GPT4-Turbo alone in Webshop and ALFWorld, as GPT4-Turbo’s broader considerations might not align well with the task instruction (as we discussed in Section [5.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.SS1 "5.1 Overall Performance ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")).

Figure 4: The Macro-F1 score of InferAct-verb when mixing different LLMs for Task Inference (Infer.) and Task Verification (Verif.). Llama-3-70B (L3-70B) shows the best average performance in both task inference and verification.

#### Does scaling law improve the Task Inference and Verification ability?

We test this using Qwen2.5 Qwen ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib26)), which offers a series of models ranging from 3B to 72B. In Abstain QA,  Feng et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib7)) found no correlation between the abstain performance of LLMs and their model size. We observe a similar pattern in the evaluation of LLM agents. As illustrated in Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ Does scaling law improve the Task Inference and Verification ability? ‣ 5.2 Analysis ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), increasing the model size does not guarantee better performance of either InferAct or Direct Prompt. Other factors such as unrequired considerations (discussed in Section [5.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.SS1 "5.1 Overall Performance ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")) may play a role and require further investigation.

#### Calibration performance of different methods.

We calculate estimated calibration error (ECE) Guo et al. ([2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib8)) for probability-based methods (Token Probability, Multi-step, InferAct-prob). Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Calibration performance of different methods. ‣ 5.2 Analysis ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") shows the ECE of different methods varies across tasks and LLMs. Token Probability demonstrates good calibration with GPT4-Turbo, but struggles with higher ECE in GPT3.5-Turbo and Llama-3-70B. Multi-step is well-calibrated in HotPotQA across models but it exhibits very poor calibration in WebShop and ALFWorld across all models. InferAct-prob shows consistent performance and achieves the best average calibration, especially with GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-3-70B. For instance, the ECE of InferAct-prob in ALFWorld is 0.116 while Token Probability is 0.583 with GPT-35-Turbo.

 |  | Method | WebShop | HotPotQA | ALFWorld |
| GPT4-Turbo | Token Prob | 0.323 | 0.188 | 0.209 |
| Multi-step | 0.341 | 0.192 | 0.432 |
| InferAct-prob | 0.390 | 0.223 | 0.299 |
| GPT-35-Turbo | Token Prob | 0.345 | 0.195 | 0.583 |
| Multi-step | 0.327 | 0.125 | 0.499 |
| InferAct-prob | 0.187 | 0.240 | 0.116 |
| Llama-3-70B | Token Prob | 0.502 | 0.180 | 0.257 |
| Multi-step | 0.291 | 0.114 | 0.439 |
| InferAct-prob | 0.269 | 0.190 | 0.136 |

### 5.3 Collaborative Dynamics Between InferAct, Actor, and the User

In this section, we evaluate whether InferAct can assist the user in improving the Actor’s performance while reducing the user’s cognitive burden. In our experiments, we investigate two forms of feedback: the binary Liu et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib18)); Shi et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib30)) and Natural-Language (NL) feedback Tandon et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib36)); Madaan et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib20)). Binary feedback, ideal for users seeking minimal engagement, directly indicates the Actor with ‘alignment/misalignment’ signals. In our experiments, we use the ground truth (refer to Appendix  [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2 "Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")) from the dataset to provide such signals and equip the Actor with self-reflection Shinn et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib31)) for performance improvement. For more detailed insights, NL feedback is suitable. However, scaling up NL feedback from real human users is difficult. Previous work Bai et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib4)); Lee et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib16)) has suggested that the feedback generated by advanced LLMs could be on par with the feedback sourced from humans in some summarization, dialogue generation, and categorization tasks. Thus, we utilize GPT4-Turbo to craft NL feedback by comparing the ground truth (e.g., the correct product in WebShop) with the predicted one (prompts in Appendix [A.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A1.SS2 "A.2 Natural Language Feedback from AI ‣ Appendix A Prompts Used in Experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")). This allows us to simulate NL feedback in a scalable and immediate way. To demonstrate InferAct can be seamlessly used with the feedback from real users, we also perform a small-scale user study in Webshop (Appendix [F](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A6 "Appendix F User Study for collaboration between InferAct, Actor, Human ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")).

To mimic the limited cognitive resources the human can provide in real-world scenarios, we cap the number of tasks that the oracle (GPT4-Turbo with gold labels) can evaluate to no more than 50% of the total tasks (c.f. Table [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2.T7 "Table 7 ‣ The Number of Trajectories To Inspect. ‣ Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents")). Importantly, false positives are prioritized in consuming this quota, reflecting their real-world cost, i.e., each false alert depletes the available cognitive resources that could be used to address an actual misalignment.

#### Performance Analysis:

As shown in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Upper Bound Comparison: ‣ 5.3 Collaborative Dynamics Between InferAct, Actor, and the User ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") and Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ Calibration performance of different methods. ‣ 5.2 Analysis ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), the Actor, guided by InferAct, consistently outperforms baselines over three iterations with both binary and NL feedback. For instance, InferAct with NL feedback surpasses the second-best method, Token Entropy, by 5% on WebShop.

#### Upper Bound Comparison:

To investigate whether InferAct can effectively assist the human user in reducing the oversight burden, we compare its performance with Full Validation where the oracle validates all tasks performed by the agent without any detector involved. The Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Upper Bound Comparison: ‣ 5.3 Collaborative Dynamics Between InferAct, Actor, and the User ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") show that InferAct achieves promising results. For instance, InferAct-prob only lags behind Full Validation by an average of 3.5% with binary feedback and 7% with NL feedback. This reveals that when equipped with InferAct, the agent can achieve highly competitive results with fewer human interventions (up to 50%). These findings highlight the feasibility of using detectors like InferAct to assist humans in identifying misalignment and improving agent performance while reducing cognitive burden.

## 6 Conclusion

Detecting and correcting misaligned behaviors before any detrimental outcome materializes is crucial for deploying LLM-based agents to real-life applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach InferAct that leverages belief reasoning in Theory of Mind to detect whether an agent deviates from the user’s intent and takes adverse actions. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of InferAct across different environments and LLMs. We further explore the collaboration between InferAct, the Actor, and the user, illustrating how this synergy prevents misaligned actions and improves the Actor’s performance. Our findings show the potential of automatic detectors like InferAct to act as proxies for human users to timely detect misaligned actions and improve the agent performance while reducing cognitive burden.

## 7 Limitations

Despite the efficacy of InferAct in preemptive adverse action detection for LLM agents, there are several limitations that warrant mention and provide avenues for future research.
First, we sum up false negatives and false positives to represent the cost they incurred. This simplification may not adequately capture the complexity of the real-world situations. For instance, in web shopping scenarios, the consequences of false negatives–failing to detect unsafe actions–can lead to increased return or refund costs while false positives–incorrectly flagging safe actions may lead to customer frustration and additional verification costs. These variables are more complex than the cost metric used in our study, highlighting the need for more fine-grained cost modeling to reflect real-world implications. Additionally, our focus was on the immediate and direct cost of adverse actions, without delving into the long-term and indirect effects that may hold substantial importance Lindner et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib17)).
Second, InferAct with two components involved could introduce more computational overheads. We present the estimated cost in Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Computational Overhead. ‣ Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"). While InferAct is cheaper than Self-Consistency, it costs more resources than direct prompting. To reduce the cost, open-source models (e.g. Llama-3-70B) can be used in suitable scenarios. As shown in Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ Which model excels in Task Inference or Verification of InferAct? ‣ 5.2 Analysis ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), mixing models can often yield better performance, while potentially reducing computational costs, offering a viable solution for managing overhead.
Third, our approach focuses on mitigating risks from misalignment with user intent. However, if the user intent is harmful such as making a bomb, our approach does not aim at solving this. Finally, given the relatively small action space in the scenarios we test, we manually define the risky actions. In open domains where the action space is vast, how to automatically discover those risky actions under the control of humans could be an interesting research direction.

## Appendix B Details of experiments

#### Temperature.

In our experiments, we set the temperature of GPT models to 0.7 for Self-Consistency while setting the temperature to 0.0 for other methods. For Llama-3-70B, greedy search is used.

#### Computational Overhead.

The computational overhead of different methods is represented in Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Computational Overhead. ‣ Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"). We calculate the average cost of different methods in terms of inference time and cost when using GPT-4-turbo in WebShop.

 | Method | Time (sec) | Cost (USD) |
| Direct Prompt | 1.2 | 0.0032 |
| Multi-Step | 2.5 | 0.0131 |
| Self-Consistency | 6.0 | 0.0128 |
| Token-Prob | 2.3 | 0.0021 |
| InferAct | 4.1 | 0.0122 | 

Table 4: The computational overhead of different methods per example in Webshop when using GPT-4-Trubo

#### Data Statistics and Threshold.

We provide the number of successful, failed, and halted trajectories the Actor agent performed in different tasks at its first trial in Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Data Statistics and Threshold. ‣ Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"). We adopt the implementation from reflexion Shinn et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib31)) which also detects halted trajectories with environment feedback. This means the agent is stuck in the environment without any results. They will be directly presented to the oracle to get feedback.

 |  | Successful | Failed | Halted | Total |
| WebShop | 90 | 182 | 28 | 300 |
| HotPotQA | 172 | 68 | 60 | 300 |
| ALFWorld | 87 | 18 | 29 | 134 | 

Table 5: The number of successful, failed, halted trajectories the Actor performed in each dataset

In Table [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2.T6 "Table 6 ‣ Data Statistics and Threshold. ‣ Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), we provide the thresholds used for probability-based methods with Llama-3-70B as the backbone. The size of the development set used for tuning is 50.

 | Method | WebShop | HotPotQA | ALFWorld |
| Token-Entropy | 0.39 | 0.14 | 0.99 |
| Token-Prob | 0.08 | 0.90 | 0.62 |
| Multi-Step | 0.01 | 0.70 | 0.99 |
| InferAct | 0.98 | 0.49 | 0.60 | 

Table 6: The thresholds used in our experiments for different methods with Llama-3-70B.

#### The Number of Trajectories To Inspect.

In section [5.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.SS3 "5.3 Collaborative Dynamics Between InferAct, Actor, and the User ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"), to simulate the real-world scenarios, we limit the number of Actor’s trajectories that the oracle is able to inspect during each iteration. The specific number is in Table [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A2.T7 "Table 7 ‣ The Number of Trajectories To Inspect. ‣ Appendix B Details of experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents").

|  | #Task |
| WebShop | 136 |
| HotPotQA | 120 |
| ALFWorld | 53 |

Table 7: The number of trajectories the oracle can check during each iteration.

#### Ground Truth.

For web shopping and HotPotQA, as the critical actions are the terminal actions, the gold labels are used to identify if the trajectory is correct. For ALFworld, we annotate the label of the trajectory based on the human demonstrations in the original dataset.

## Appendix C Related Work

#### Trustworthiness of LLM Agents.

As LLM agents have the capability of interacting with external environments to complete various tasks, it becomes crucial to address the potential irreversible consequences of their actions and determine when human oversight is necessary. Ruan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib27)) propose ToolEmu, an LM-based emulation framework where LLMs emulate tool/API execution and assess the potential risk in the emulation environment. Based on this, Agent constitution is proposed by Hua et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib11)) to enrich the framework by evaluating LLM agents during three stages: pre-planning, in-planning, and post-planning. However, emulation-based methods cannot guarantee that emulated execution always aligns with the execution in complex real-world environments. R-Judge Yuan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib50)) proposes an agent-based safety benchmark. However, it only provides static agent trajectories. We investigate the synergy between the Actor agent, Critic, and human in dynamic environments to improve the performance iteratively.

#### Evaluation and Feedback Acquisition of LLM Agents in critical scenarios.

Current research generally assumes that feedback is either available post-execution Shinn et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib31)); Yao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib49)); Zhou et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib53)); Kim et al. ([2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib14)) or completely unavailable during task inference Kim et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib13)); Song et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib33)); Zhao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib51)). The post-execution feedback is typically autonomously obtained after terminal actions such as a ‘buy-now’ command in online shopping. However, this does not necessarily reflect real-world scenarios where such direct correctness feedback is often absent. In such cases, the only feedback that might be available after terminal actions is human feedback, which assesses whether the agent has adequately fulfilled the given instructions.

Without the assumption of post-execution feedback, studies have explored how to use gold labels or human feedback to acquire insights during offline learning Yang et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib45)); Qian et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib25)); Zhao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib51)); Song et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib33)). Co-learning Qian et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib25)) focuses on extracting experience from shortcut-oriented past trajectories while ExpeL Zhao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib51)) takes a different approach by distilling insights from historical trials during the training phase and subsequently guides the agent’s inferential processes.  Song et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib33)) collects failed trajectories using correctness feedback and applies contrastive learning to fine-tune agents on pairs of successful and failed trajectories. Contrary to these offline learning, our work focuses on real-time error detection and the strategic acquisition of human feedback during online operations especially for irreversible actions. A closely related work by Pan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib23)) evaluates the agent trajectory to improve the performance of web agents. Our work differs in two key aspects: 1) they generally assess the whole trajectory to boost the agent performance while we prioritize real-time misaligned action detection and correction to prevent negative consequences in critical environments. This focus not only underlines the importance of performance but also emphasizes reliability measures for real-life deployment. 2) We explore the collaborative dynamics between the evaluator, the Actor agent, and the user in scenarios involving critical decision-making. The prompt method used by  Pan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib23)) is direct prompting. To compare with it, we include it in our baseline.

#### Machine Theory-of-Mind.

Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is the cognitive capability to enable humans to attribute mental states (e.g. beliefs, intents) to oneself and others Premack and Woodruff ([1978](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib24)). This ability allows humans to comprehend that others may have different thoughts, beliefs from their own and thus anticipate how others might behave. ToM includes a series of tasks such as inferring others’ intent based on interconnected actions or reflecting on someone else’s mental states. The emergent ToM ability in LLMs has sparked lots of research interest. As LLMs become increasingly capable, their emergent cognitive abilities (e.g. ToM) have sparked considerable interest within the fields of psychology and cognitive science Hagendorff ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib9)); Hagendorff et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib10)); Almeida et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib3)); Xu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib44)); Kosinski ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib15)); Bubeck et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib5)); Shapira et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib29)); Ullman ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib37)). Recent studies Kosinski ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib15)); Bubeck et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib5)) demonstrate that LLMs exhibit strong ToM abilities while  Shapira et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib29)); Ullman ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib37)) indicate that GPTs are susceptible to minor alterations in the false belief task. However, the follow-up study Strachan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib34)) reveals humans also face challenges in these alterations. Moreover,  Strachan et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib34)) undertakes a comprehensive comparison of LLM performance against 1,907 human participants across various ToM aspects. It demonstrates that GPT models excel in false beliefs and non-literal expressions but falter in recognizing faux pas. Previous studies mostly focus on the evaluation of the ToM ability of LLMs. We perform a preliminary step to leverage the ToM ability of LLMs to assist humans detect off-track behaviors of LLM agents in critical decision-making scenarios.

## Appendix E Task Description

#### WebShop.

The WebShop task and dataset Yao et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib47)) are a practical online shopping benchmark with 1.18 million real-world products with descriptions and 12k user instructions. An agent needs to purchase products that satisfy the user’s instructions (e.g. I am looking for a white vanity bench and priced lower than $100) by browsing the e-commerce website. The actions the agent can take include: (1) search[query], which performs search with a search bar (e.g. search[a white vanity bench]), and (2) click[button], which navigates the website. The buttons include product title, options (e.g. size/color), description, back to search, prev/next page, buy, and so forth. This task is evaluated by the success rate that the Actor can find the item needed by the user. The critical action in this dataset is click[Buy Now] as misoperation can lead to money loss to users. Previous studies use 100 Shinn et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib31)); Yao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib49)) or 50 tasks Zhou et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib53)) as test data. Our evaluation expands this to use 300 tasks to ensure broader validation and reliability.

#### HotPotQA.

This is a wikipedia-based question answering dataset Yang et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib46)). Notably, HotPotQA is widely used in various setups such as information retrieval or LLM agents. In our paper, we follow the agent setup in ReAct Yao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib48)) where the agent can only access Wikipedia APIs with three actions to find the answer to a given question. The tools include: (1) search[entity], which returns the first five sentences from the wiki page for the searched entity if it exists or suggests similar entities, (2) lookup[string], which returns the next sentence in the page containing the string, (3) finish[answer], which returns the answer found by the agent. The critical action is finish[answer] as it often affects the user’s satisfaction with the system, e.g., in the context of customer service. The evaluation metric used in the HotPotQA is the exact match between the predicted answer and the golden answer. Our evaluation size is 300 tasks.

#### ALFWorld.

This is a household task Shridhar et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib32)) where an agent needs to complete a user’s task (e.g., clean the soapbar and put it into the cabinet.) by exploring environments. It includes six different types of tasks, including Pick & Place, Examine in Light, Clean & Place, Heat & Place, Cool & Place, Pick Two & Place. The critical actions include Clean, Heat, Cool since these actions involve potential irreversible physical state changes to the objects being operated. For example, if the agent cleans something that should not be wet, it could damage the item. Besides, the task completion is also a critical action. Following previous work Yao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib48)); Shinn et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib31)); Yao et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib49)); Zhou et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#bib.bib53)), we conduct evaluations across all 134 unseen validation tasks.

## Appendix F User Study for collaboration between InferAct, Actor, Human

To demonstrate the practical utility of InferAct to collaborate with human users, we conducted a user study with three human users in Webshop. This study aims to showcase how InferAct can assist human users in detecting misaligned actions by the Actor agent. The setup is the same as Section [5.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#S5.SS3 "5.3 Collaborative Dynamics Between InferAct, Actor, and the User ‣ 5 Experiment Results and Analysis ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") apart from the feedback sourced by the human rather than GPT4-Turbo. We present the instruction in Appendix [A.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A1.SS2 "A.2 Natural Language Feedback from AI ‣ Appendix A Prompts Used in Experiments ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") to the human user, the human user needs to give feedback to the Actor when InferAct flags the Actor’s trajectory as misalignment. We randomly sample 100 tasks from WebShop. The result is presented in Figure [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A6.F25 "Figure 25 ‣ Appendix F User Study for collaboration between InferAct, Actor, Human ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents") and Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.11843v3#A6.T9 "Table 9 ‣ Appendix F User Study for collaboration between InferAct, Actor, Human ‣ Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents"). The results demonstrate that the Actor, guided by InferAct, still achieved the best performance when feedback was sourced from the human user. Additionally, the results indicate the feedback generated by GPT-4-Turbo achieves comparable performance to using human-generated feedback.
