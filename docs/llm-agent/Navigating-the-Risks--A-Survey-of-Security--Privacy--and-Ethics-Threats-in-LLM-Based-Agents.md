###### Abstract.

With the continuous development of large language models (LLMs), transformer-based models have made groundbreaking advances in numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leading to the emergence of a series of agents that use LLMs as their control hub. While LLMs have achieved success in various tasks, they face numerous security and privacy threats, which become even more severe in the agent scenarios. To enhance the reliability of LLM-based applications, a range of research has emerged to assess and mitigate these risks from different perspectives.

To help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of various risks, this survey collects and analyzes the different threats faced by these agents. To address the challenges posed by previous taxonomies in handling cross-module and cross-stage threats, we propose a novel taxonomy framework based on the sources and impacts. Additionally, we identify six key features of LLM-based agents, based on which we summarize the current research progress and analyze their limitations. Subsequently, we select four representative agents as case studies to analyze the risks they may face in practical use. Finally, based on the aforementioned analyses, we propose future research directions from the perspectives of data, methodology, and policy, respectively.

## 1\. Introduction

With the continuous development of language models (LMs), LLMs based on the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib260)) have achieved significant success in various fields of NLP (Devlin, [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib63); Radford et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib215)). The massive number of parameters and extensive training data endow LLMs with strong capabilities in tasks like text generation (Touvron et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib254); Brown et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib25)), code assistance (Feng et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib80); Wang et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib273)), logical reasoning (Wei et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib278); Yao et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib298)), etc. Due to their powerful understanding capabilities, an increasing number of studies are positioning LLMs as the core decision-making hub of AI agents (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190); Shen et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib236)), which are sophisticated software programs designed to autonomously perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Compared to earlier AI agents based on heuristic algorithms or reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib186); Lillicrap et al., [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib155)), LLM-based agents can communicate with users, making them easier to understand and accept. Additionally, their vast foundational knowledge allows them to think in a manner similar to humans (understanding + planning). These characteristics contribute to their popularity, making them a promising direction for AI to serve various practical fields (Zhang et al., [2024e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib318); Wang et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib264); Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311)). For example, Supertools (Supertools, [[n. d.]](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib248)) is a comprehensive collection of trending applications empowered by LLMs.

Despite the significant success of LLMs, they also face security and privacy threats due to inner vulnerabilities or outer attacks. LLM-based agents add some components and functionalities, which makes these risks even more threatening. For example, LLMs face jailbreaking attacks  (Shen et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib234); Liu et al., [2023e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib169)), which refer to the process to bypass their built-in safety mechanisms  (Bai et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib18); Ouyang et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib199)). In the context of LLM-based agents, LLMs need to handle multi-round dialogues and multiple sources of information, making jailbreaking attacks more complex and difficult to defend against (Anil et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib13); Cheng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib48)). To uncover the vulnerabilities of LLM-based agents and make them more secure and reliable, an increasing number of studies focus on the threats from various perspectives.

To help researchers better understand LLM-based agents and pursue future research work, there exist two surveys (Deng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib62); Cui et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib54)) to summarize the security risks of LLM-based agents. They categorize the security risks based on the composition (called modules) or operational phases (called stages) of the agents as follows. (i) The module perspectives. Cui et al. (Cui et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib54)) identified four key modules in LLM-based systems, i.e., the input module, the LM module, the toolchain module, and the output module. They summarize the risks of LLM-based agents based on the four modules. (ii) The stage perspectives. Deng et al. (Deng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib62)) identified four key knowledge gaps in LLM-based AI agents, i.e., the stage of perception, the stage of internal execution, the stage of action in environment, and the stage of interaction with untrusted external entities. They summarize the risks of LLM-based agents based on the four stages. These two taxonomies clearly highlight the sources of attacks faced by LLM-based agents. However, they struggle to accurately pinpoint threats that span across modules and stages. For example, privacy leakage is caused by memory issues within the language model module, but it occurs at the output module. Similarly, goal hijacking can happen not only during the perception stage but also during the interaction stage with external data (Abdelnabi et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib6)). These cross-module and cross-stage threats are inaccurately pinpointed to a single module or stage.

Figure 1\. The overall framework of our taxonomy for the risks of LLM-based agents.

Our Design.  To categorize various threats of LLM-based agents more accurately and comprehensively, we propose a novel taxonomy by mapping the threats into a binary table based on their sources and types. (i) For the sources of threats, we consider the operational nature of LLM-based agents: LLMs make decisions based on inputs from multiple sources, as shown in Fig. [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1\. Introduction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") left. As a probabilistic model, the output decision distribution of an LLM is determined by both the input and the model itself. Therefore, we attribute the threats to LLM-based agents to the inputs, the model, or a combination of both. Compared to categorizing attacks by modules or stages, our classification of sources is closer to the essence of the threat. For example, goal hijacking (Qiang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib214); Huang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib110); Liu et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib170)) may originate from a user input or an external database, but both fundamentally act as inputs to the model for hijacking the goal. (ii) For the types of threats, we categorize the threats into three classes: security/safety, privacy, and ethics. Specifically, if a threat results in the model producing incorrect outputs (including errors that are factually inaccurate or do not align with the needs of developers or users), it is categorized as a security/safety issue, such as adversarial examples  (Yin et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib300)). If a threat leads to the leakage of privacy, it is classified as a privacy issue, such as prompt leakage attacks (Yu et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib304); Zhang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib324)). If a threat does not produce “incorrect” outputs but raises concerns such as unfairness, it falls under ethical issues, such as bias (Gallegos et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib82)).

We collect papers from the top conferences and highly cited arXiv papers. Top conferences are included but not limited: IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, USENIX Security, NDSS, ACL, CVPR, NIPS, ICML, and ICLR. We categorize different kinds of threats with our taxonomy in Fig. [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1\. Introduction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") right. For threats originating from inputs, we refer to them as *problematic inputs*. In this scenario, attackers cannot modify the model but can design inputs to induce malicious outputs or behaviors, e.g., the adversarial example. For threats from within the model, we refer to them as *model flaws*. In this scenario, the inputs are always benign, but the model’s own defects lead to malicious outputs or behaviors, e.g., the hallucination problem. For threats arising from both model flaws and carefully crafted inputs, we refer to them as *combined threats*. In this scenario, the inputs are deliberately designed by attackers to exploit the model’s vulnerabilities, e.g., the backdoor attack.

Figure 2\. An overall framework of LLM-based agents.

Our Contributions.  Compared with recent surveys (Deng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib62); Cui et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib54)) on the security risks of LLM-based agents, there are three main advantages of our work.

(i) A Novel Taxonomy of Threats. We propose a novel taxonomy that maps threats into a binary table based on their sources and impacts, which can comprehensively cover the existing threats and extend to future threats, including the cross-module and cross-stage threats.

(ii) Detailed Analysis of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many tasks require agents to handle inputs from multiple modalities, (e.g., city navigation systems (Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311))), leading to the emergence of a range of MLLMs and agents based on these models (Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311); Yang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib296)). Previous surveys primarily focus on the text modality, lacking analysis of multimodal models. We cover both LLMs and MLLMs, placing particular emphasis on analyzing the new challenges and threats posed by multimodal tasks in the context of threats.

(iii) Four Carefully Selected Case Studies. Previous surveys analyze the risks based on a general framework of LLM-based agents (or systems). However, actual agents may not necessarily contain all modules in the general framework, and the designs within these modules may also be customized (Dong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib67)). More importantly, the scenarios they face have significant differences, resulting in the varying levels and causes of threats. To help readers better understand the actual threats faced by agents, we present case studies of four different agents, representing four classic situations in Section [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S6 "6\. Case Study ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents").

This paper is organized as follows. Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2 "2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") introduces a general framework of LLM-based agents and identifies six key features of the framework. Sections [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3 "3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S4 "4\. Risks from Model Flaws ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), and [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S5 "5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") depict the risks from problematic inputs, model flaws, and input-model interaction, respectively. Section [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S6 "6\. Case Study ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") offers four carefully selected case studies. Section [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S7 "7\. Future Direction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") gives future directions for the development of this field.

## 2\. LLM-based Agent

AI agents are considered promising a research direction that utilize AI technology to autonomously execute specific tasks and make decisions. In previous researches, AI agents often achieved good results in specific scenarios (such as playing games) through heuristic strategies or reinforcement learning (Lillicrap et al., [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib155))(Mnih et al., [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib186))(Schulman et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib227))(Wilkins, [2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib280)). In recent years, LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have attracted substantial attention from both academia, and industry, due to their remarkable performance on various NLP tasks (Brown et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib25))(Zhang et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib322))(Vaswani et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib260)). Therefore, there is an increasing amount of work studying the use of LLMs as the decision-making center for AI agents (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190))(Ahn et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib10))(Park et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib201)). With the development of LLMs, LLMs can handle more modalities and tasks (Shen et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib236)).

Framework of LLM-based Agents.  In our work, we consider a comprehensive framework of an LLM-based agent that covers the modules and runtime modes of mainstream LLM-based agents, as shown in Fig. [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1\. Introduction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"). This framework contains the following four modules.

(i) Input Module (IM). IM receives the users’ inputs and preprocesses them as follows. First, IM formats the inputs to a specific distribution (e.g., normalize an input image) or a specific format (e.g., a special language (Sharma et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib230))). Second, IM implements harmful information detection (Roy et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib222))(Yang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib294)) or purification (Sharma et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib230)). Third, many LLM-based agents add a system prompt before the inputs (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190))(Shen et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib236)).

(ii) Decision Module (DM). DM understands and analyzes the query of the user, gives plans and generates the final response to the user. Many agents’ decision modules only contain one LLM. They leverage an LLM for understanding, planning, and feedback (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190))(Shen et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib236)), or use an LLM for understanding and feedback, with another non-LLM planner handling the planning (Liu et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib160))(Dagan et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib55)). As tasks become more complex, many agents employ multiple LLMs to accomplish the aforementioned tasks. For example, VOYAGER (Wang et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib264)) uses GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to handle the tasks of understanding, planning, and generating a skill library, respectively. Huang et al. (Huang et al., [2022a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib107)) used GPT-3 for task planning, while leveraging BERT to translate the plans into admissible actions.

(iii) External Entities (EE). With the task becoming more complex, the agents need the help of the external modules, including memory module, external tools, the other agents and the environment. The memory module is used to store and retrieve relevant information to improve the coherence and context-awareness of the agent’s responses. In this paper, we adopt the definition of agents’ memory from (Zhang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib328)), considering external databases as a form of agents’ memory as well. External tools integrate numerous APIs to fulfill the user’s requirements (e.g., search engine APIs for Webgpt (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190)) and APIs for controlling the robotic arm (Ahn et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib10))). Sometimes, multiple agents need to collaborate to complete a task, where one agent needs to interact with other agents (Hong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib99)).

(iv) Output Module (OM). There might be zero or multiple interaction between DM and EE to accomplish the task. After that, DM generates the response and delivers it to the user through OM. Agents can implement harmful information detection or purification on the output (Hu et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib104)).

Figure 3\. Six key features of LLM-based agents: LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs and outputs, multi-source inputs, multi-round interaction, memory mechanism and tool invocation.

Based on this framework, we identify six key features of LLM-based agents, which involve new attack surfaces compared with the traditional DNN models and the RL-based agents. As shown in Fig. [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), these six key features are as follows. (i) LLM-based controller. LLMs serve as the core of agents, leveraging transformer architecture, vast amounts of knowledge, and massive training data to confer strong understanding capabilities, while also introducing new risks. (ii) Multi-modal inputs and outputs. As agents become capable of handling increasingly complex tasks, many scenarios require the processing of multimodal information. Research indicates that risks vary across different modalities, and their interaction in multimodal systems presents unique challenges and opportunities. (iii) Multi-source inputs. The inputs to LLMs within agents consist of multiple components from different sources, such as user input, system prompts, memory, and environmental feedback. Compared to a standalone LLM, multi-source inputs present new opportunities and challenges for both attackers and defenders. (iv) Multi-round interaction. Agents often require multiple rounds of interaction (with the environment, users, other LLMs, etc.) to complete tasks, leading to longer and more complex inputs for LLMs, which may exacerbate certain threats. (v) Memory mechanism. The memory mechanisms in agents can help accumulate experience and enhance knowledge, improving their ability to handle various tasks, but they also introduce new security and privacy risks. (vi) Tool invocation. LLMs are specially crafted with instruction-tuning data designed for tool usage. This process enables LLMs to handle complex tasks, but it may also result in more severe consequences and introduce new vulnerabilities.

Figure 4\. The mapping of key features to identified threats based on collected literature.

In the following sections, we comprehensively introduce the aforementioned threats based on the taxonomy. Fig. [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") indicates the presence of studies linking specific characteristics of LLM-based agents to various threats. Each checkmark represents a documented research contribution that addresses the corresponding feature-threat relationship. For every threat, we summarize its technical progress based on six key features and identity the limitations of the current research. In Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), we show the key papers for each threat. For brevity, we abbreviate “LLM-based controller” as LC, “Multi-modal inputs and outputs” as MMIO, “Multi-source inputs” as MSI, “Multi-round interaction” as MRI, “Memory mechanism” as MM, and “Tool invocation” as TI in the table.

## 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs

This section focuses on the risks that arise due to issues with the input data, such as adversarial examples, prompt injection, etc. that can lead to problems with the LLM-based agent’s performance and behavior. Compared with a standalone LLM, the decision module of an LLM-based agent can receive inputs from different modules, which increases its attack surface. For each risk, we first introduce what they are, then summarize their technological advancements in the six key features of LLM-based agents, and finally analyze their limitations.

### 3.1\. Adversarial Example

An adversarial example is an adversarial-perturbed sample preserving the semantics but misclassified by the deep learning models. Specifically,

| (1) |  | $\mathbf{\delta^{*}}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\delta\in\Delta}\mathop{SemDis}(% x,x+\delta)$ |  |

|  | $\displaystyle\text{s.t.}~{}~{}\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}g(x+\delta^{*})\neq o~% {}~{}\text{(Untargeted)}\\ g(x+\delta^{*})=t~{}~{}~{}\text{(Targeted)}\end{array}\right.$ |  |

where $\mathop{SemDis}()$ denotes the semantic distance between the perturbed sample and the original sample, $\Delta$ represents the feasible perturbation space, and $g()$ signifies the target model. If the adversarial perturbation makes the target model misclassify the original label $o$ of the sample, it represents the untargeted attack ($g(x+\delta^{*})\neq o$). If the adversarial perturbation makes the target model misclassify the sample to a target label $t$, it represents the targeted attack ($g(x+\delta^{*})=t$).

The research of adversarial examples has passed over ten years (Szegedy et al., [2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib250)), raising attention in many domains, e.g., autonomous driving (Eykholt et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib74)), malware detection (He et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib95)), reinforcement learning (Wu et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib286)), etc. Szegedy et al. (Szegedy et al., [2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib250)) first discovered the adversarial example in the neural networks, which opens Pandora’s box of the adversarial example. According to the knowledge of the attacker, the adversarial example attack methods can be categorized into perfect knowledge attack, limited knowledge attack, and zero knowledge attack. The history of adversarial example attacks starts from the perfect knowledge attack (Carlini and Wagner, [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib38)) to the zero knowledge attack (Chen et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib44)), which is a more practical setting. Correspondingly, the development of the defense method is from the empirical methods, e.g., defensive distillation (Papernot et al., [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib200)), obfuscated gradients (Buckman et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib26); Athalye et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib14)), etc, to the theoretical methods, certificated robustness (Du et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib71); Mao et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib180)). The arms race of adversarial example attacks and defenses exists from deep learning models and LLMs to LLM-based AI agents. In the context of LLM-based agents, as shown in [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 3.1\. Adversarial Example ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), the development of adversarial examples primarily involves four key features: LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs and outputs, multi-source inputs, and multi-round interaction. In the following, we review the recent advancements in both attack and defense perspectives.

Figure 5\. Adversarial examples targeting LLM-based agents may involve four key features (indicated with a red exclamation mark), leading to incorrect output.

#### 3.1.1\. Technical Progress

Attack Perspective.  As discussed in section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2 "2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), the input and output interactions of LLM-based AI agents are characterized by their handling of multi-modal data across multiple rounds of interaction. This complexity necessitates a nuanced approach to adversarial example attacks, which increasingly focus on the relationships between different modalities within these interactions.

Recent research in this area has produced several sophisticated methods for attacking multi-modal systems. For instance, RIATIG (Liu et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib162)) introduces a reliable and imperceptible adversarial example attack targeting text-to-image models. This method employs a genetic-based optimization loss function aimed at improving the quality of adversarial samples, ensuring that the generated examples are both effective and difficult to detect. VLATTACK (Yin et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib300)), advances the field by generating adversarial samples that fuse perturbations from both images and text. This fusion occurs at both single-modal and multi-modal levels, making the attacks more versatile and challenging to defend against. The method’s ability to operate across modalities highlights the increasing sophistication of adversarial techniques as they target the interconnected nature of multi-modal systems.

Beyond direct adversarial attacks, there is significant focus on the transferability of adversarial examples across different vision-language models (VLMs). For example, SGA (Lu et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib173)) generates adversarial examples by leveraging diverse cross-modal interactions among multiple image-text pairs. This method incorporates alignment-preserving augmentation combined with cross-modal guidance, allowing adversarial examples to maintain their efficacy across various models and tasks. Similarly, TMM (Wang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib265)) enhances the transferability of adversarial examples through attention-directed feature perturbation. By targeting critical attention regions and disrupting modality-consistency features, this approach increases the likelihood that adversarial examples will succeed across different VLMs.

Another line of adversarial example attack methods specifically targets downstream applications that involve multiple rounds of interaction. For instance, Liu et al. (Liu et al., [2022a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib164)) proposed imitation adversarial example attacks against neural ranking models, with the goal of manipulating ranking results to achieve desired outcomes. This method exemplifies how adversarial attacks can exploit the iterative nature of certain applications to progressively distort the final output. Similarly, NatLogAttack (Zheng and Zhu, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib333)) leverages adversarial examples to compromise models based on natural logic, introducing subtle perturbations that undermine the model’s reasoning processes. In the domain of dialogue generation, DGSlow (Li et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib147)) generates adversarial examples by defining two objective loss functions that target both response accuracy and length. This approach ensures that the generated responses not only deviate from expected content but also manipulate the conversational flow, making the attack more disruptive.

Defense Perspective.  Defense methods against adversarial examples are broadly categorized into two primary types: input-level defenses and model-level defenses. Each of these approaches targets different aspects of the adversarial threat landscape, aiming to enhance the robustness of LLM-based AI agents against adversarial perturbations.

Input-level defenses primarily focus on detecting and mitigating adversarial examples before they can influence the model’s predictions. These defenses typically employ techniques for adversarial example detection and purification. Most of the existing input-level defense methods (Bao et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib19); Keller et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib124); Wang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib274); Li et al., [2022a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib141); Mosca et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib187)) in the domain of LLM-based AI agents leverage LLMs to identify and neutralize adversarial inputs effectively. For instance, ADFAR (Bao et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib19)) implements multi-task learning techniques to enable LLMs to distinguish adversarial input samples from benign ones. Similarly, methods such as BERT-defense (Keller et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib124)) and the approach proposed by Li et al. (Li et al., [2022a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib141)) utilized the BERT model to purify adversarial perturbations, thereby safeguarding the model’s outputs from being compromised by malicious inputs. The SOTA input-level defense strategies have begun to focus on the prompt mechanisms within LLM-based AI agents, as discussed in section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2 "2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"). For example, APT (Li et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib140)) enhances the robustness of the CLIP model by leveraging soft prompts, which serve as an additional layer of defense against adversarial manipulation by refining the model’s input processing pipeline.

Model-level defenses (Zhou et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib337); Dong et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib68); Wang et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib263); Liu et al., [2022b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib166); Le et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib133)), on the other hand, are concerned with the architecture and parameters of the model itself. These defenses aim to create inherently robust models through techniques such as adversarial training and fine-tuning specific model parameters. For instance, RIFT (Dong et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib68)) employs mutual information to achieve robust fine-tuning, and InforBERT (Wang et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib263)) designs the information bottleneck regularizer and the anchored feature regularizer for adversarial training. To address the high computational cost associated with retraining entire models, some methods like SHIELD (Le et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib133)) propose retraining only the final layer of LLMs. This approach significantly reduces the training overhead while still providing a degree of robustness against adversarial examples. The most advanced model-level defense method currently available, Dynamic Attention (Shen et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib233)), leverages a dynamic attention mechanism to enhance the robustness of transformer-based models. This method represents a significant advancement in the development of robust transformer-based models by dynamically adjusting the model’s attention mechanisms in response to potential adversarial threats.

#### 3.1.2\. Discussion of Limitations

Attack Perspective.  Current adversarial attack methods are primarily focused on untargeted attacks, where the attack objectives are not precisely defined. As a result, the outcomes of these attacks cannot be explicitly controlled to induce specific, pre-determined misbehavior. For example, adversarial perturbations applied to images fail to generate targeted responses, such as causing a specific erroneous answer in visual question-answering tasks. Additionally, as discussed in Section [3.1.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.SS1.SSS1 "3.1.1\. Technical Progress ‣ 3.1\. Adversarial Example ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), existing adversarial attack strategies aimed at multi-modal systems often engage with multiple modalities simultaneously. However, the constraint metrics used to evaluate the success of these attacks are typically designed for single-modality scenarios. This approach may be inadequate when adversarial perturbations must be applied across different modalities, as it does not account for the unique interactions between distinct data types.

Furthermore, as discussed in Section [3.1.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.SS1.SSS1 "3.1.1\. Technical Progress ‣ 3.1\. Adversarial Example ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), the scope of current adversarial example attacks remains confined to targeting the output module of LLM-based agents. However, there are additional, unexplored targets for adversarial example attacks. Specifically, vulnerabilities may exist within the memory, external tool interfaces, and the planner components of these agents, which remain under-investigated. For instance, adversarial example attacks could potentially disrupt the planning capabilities of LLM-based agents, leading them to devise incorrect or suboptimal plans. Expanding the attack surface beyond the output module to include these other critical components could reveal new dimensions of adversarial risks in complex systems.

Defense Perspective.  Current defense mechanisms against adversarial examples in LLM-based agents remain constrained to single-modal inputs and the robustness of individual models. For instance, dynamic attention (Shen et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib233)), a state-of-the-art adversarial defense technique within LLM-based agents, is limited to NLP tasks. However, LLM-based AI agents are increasingly handling multi-modal input data that extends beyond the scope of a single model. Furthermore, the decision-making module within these agents may incorporate multiple LLMs, each exhibiting varying degrees of robustness against adversarial attacks. Despite this, existing defense strategies focus exclusively on enhancing the robustness of a single model, neglecting the broader issue of joint robustness across multiple models integrated into the system.

In addition, current adversarial defense methods for LLM-based AI agents overlook key components such as the memory and planner modules, which may provide additional avenues for defending against adversarial examples. For instance, the memory bank could be leveraged to detect and counteract adversarial attack patterns by recognizing recurring attack tactics. Future strategies could extend the defense scope to include these often overlooked modules, achieving more comprehensive protection against adversarial threats.

### 3.2\. Goal Hijacking

![Refer to caption](img/eec9920750de163ed2cc81cf6acd130f.png)

Figure 6\. Goal hijacking targeting LLM-based agents may involve six key features (indicated with a red exclamation mark), leading to attacker-targeted output.

Goal hijacking refers to an attack strategy in which an adversary manipulates the objective or behavior of an AI model, causing it to deviate from its intended purpose. By introducing adversarial inputs or modifying the system’s environment, the attacker can influence the model to pursue the attacker’s desired outcome instead of the original goal. A naive attack can achieve goal hijacking of a large model by inserting “ignore the previous instruction…” into the user’s reference statement, thus shifting the model’s response to meet the attacker’s requirements.

In the context of LLM-based agents, the sources and targets of goal hijacking attacks have become more varied. As shown in Fig. [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 3.2\. Goal Hijacking ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), the development of goal hijacking in LLM-based agents primarily involves six key features: LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs, multi-source inputs, multi-round interaction, memory mechanism, and tool invocation. In the following, we review the recent advancements in both attack and defense perspectives.

#### 3.2.1\. Technical Progress

Attack Perspective.  Early attempts to exploit this vulnerability used heuristic prompts, such as “ignore the previous question,” to achieve targeted hijacking attacks on standalone LLMs (Perez and Ribeiro, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib208)). In order to make the attacks more covert and successful, more carefully designed methods have been proposed. In terms of attack methods, some approaches use vocabulary searches to obtain more covert attack prompts (Levi and Neumann, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib137)), while others leverage gradient optimization to obtain higher success rate and transferable adversarial prompts (Qiang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib214); Huang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib110); Liu et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib170)).

As LLMs are applied to different domains and tasks, researchers have begun to focus on the forms and methods of targeted hijacking attacks in various scenarios. In multimodal scenarios, researchers have found that semantic injections in the visual modality can hijack LLMs (Kimura et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib127)). For memory modules, researchers have discovered that target hijacking can be achieved by contaminating the database of RAG (Pasquini et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib203)). In multi-round interaction scenarios, researchers have found that confusing the model can be achieved by forging chat logs (Wei et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib277)). Regarding tool invocation, researchers have exposed the threat of goal hijacking to LLM-based agents using tools through analysis of actual tool-integrated LLMs and the establishment of benchmarks (Greshake et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib89); Zhan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib315)).

Defense Perspective.  Current defenses against goal hijacking can be categorized into two main types. The first type involves defenses from an *external perspective*. The second type focuses on defenses from an *endogenous perspective*.

From the perspective of external defenses, strategies primarily involve prompt engineering and prompt purification. Hines et al. (Hines et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib98)) introduced strategies such as segmentation, data marking, and encoding, which enhance the LLM’s ability to recognize inputs from multiple sources and thus effectively defend against goal hijacking. Sharma et al. (Sharma et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib230)) introduced a system prompt meta-language, a domain-specific language designed to refine prompts and monitor inputs for LLM-based chatbots to guard against attacks. They developed a system that utilizes this language to conduct real-time inspection of attack prompts, ensuring user inputs align with the chatbot’s definitions and thus preventing malicious operations. Additionally, Chen et al. (Chen et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib46)) proposed a defense method for structured queries that separates prompts and data to counteract goal hijacking.

Endogenous defenses primarily involve fine-tuning and neuron activation anomaly detection. Wallace et al. (Wallace et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib262)) proposed a fine-tuning method that establishes an instruction hierarchy, enabling the model to prioritize privileged instructions for defending against attacks, such as goal hijacking. Using supervised fine-tuning, they trained the model to recognize and execute instructions across different privilege levels, thereby enhancing its robustness against attacks. Piet et al. (Piet et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib209)) introduced Jatmo, a method using task-specific fine-tuning to create models resistant to goal hijacking. They showed that Jatmo leverages a teacher model to generate task-specific datasets and fine-tune a base model, effectively defending against goal hijacking. Abdelnabi et al. (Abdelnabi et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib6)) explored detecting task drift caused by inputs by analyzing the activations of LLMs. They showed how comparing activations before and after processing external data can detect task changes, effectively identifying task drift induced by goal hijacking.

#### 3.2.2\. Discussion of Limitations

Current defenses against multimodal goal hijacking are insufficient. Attackers can leverage multiple modalities and their combinations for covert attacks, making defense more complex. Effectively defending against goal hijacking in multimodal inputs is a crucial direction for future research. Moreover, existing external defenses are often tailored to specific types of attacks. Developing a universal external defense strategy is an important area to explore. Finally, detecting goal hijacking from a neuronal perspective holds potential. Systematic testing is needed to determine whether the activation values of target neurons can effectively indicate anomalies associated with goal hijacking, thus proposing an efficient endogenous defense strategy from this perspective.

### 3.3\. Model Extraction

Model extraction (stealing) attacks aim to achieve performance close to that of the black-box commercial models while incurring a relatively low computational cost. Attackers carefully design a set of inputs in order to steal the structure, parameters, or functionality of the target model. In the context of LLM-based agents, the development of model extraction attacks mainly involves LLM-based controllers. In the following, we review the recent advancements in both attack and defense perspectives.

#### 3.3.1\. Technical Progress

Attack Perspective.  In traditional DNNs, attackers typically have two main objectives. 1\. Make the surrogate model’s performance as consistent as possible with the target model (i.e., function-level extraction). 2\. Make the substitute model’s parameters as consistent as possible with the target model (i.e., parameter-level extraction) (Milli et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib184); Jagielski et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib114); Carlini et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib34); Shamir et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib229)). With the introduction of the transformer, NLP tasks evolve from RNN structures to transformer-based structures. The scale of LMs also become larger: from the relatively large BERT to the open-source large model LLaMA, and further to the extremely large commercial models like GPT-4\. Model extraction attacks also become more challenging. On BERT, there is not yet any work on achieving parameter-level attacks on the entire model. A few papers discuss function-level extraction (He et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib96); Krishna et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib131); Xu et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib289); Zanella-Beguelin et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib309)). Their attack logic is consistent with the traditional DNN scenario, mainly focusing on how to create the query dataset (He et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib96); Krishna et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib131)) and the training loss function (Xu et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib289)). On commercial models, due to the cost constraints of training substitute models, model extraction attacks focus on stealing a part of the target model. Li et al. (Li et al., [2024d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib148)) trained a model (e.g., CodeBERT (Feng et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib80)) and CodeT5 (Wang et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib273))) to extract the specialized code abilities of text-davinci-003\. Naseh et al. (Naseh et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib192)) stole the decoding algorithm of LLM. Carlini et al. (Carlini et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib36)) stole the last layer of a production LLM.

Defense Perspective.  In traditional DNNs, the defenders typically have two lines to defend against model extraction attacks. 1\. Active defense: prevent the model from being extracted. 2\. Passive defense: verify the ownership of the extracted model. As LMs become larger, active defense in the LLM scenario is still an area to be explored. Researchers have mainly considered passive defenses, which add watermarks to the model’s outputs as a way to verify ownership. The advantage of watermarking is that it does not require modifying the model itself, but only perturbing the model’s inputs. For example, Zhao et al. (Zhao et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib330)) perturbed the probability vector of transformer; He et al. (He et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib97)) perturbed the generated words of Bart (Lewis et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib138)); Li et al. (Li et al., [2023e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib149)) perturbed the generated codes of CodeBERT (Feng et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib80)) and CodeT5 (Wang et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib273)); Peng et al. (Peng et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib207)) perturbed the embeddings of the GPT-3.

#### 3.3.2\. Discussion of Limitations

There are two limitations of recent research on model extraction attacks. (i) Most LLM-based agents contain large open-source models (e.g. LLaMA) or commercial large models (e.g. ChatGPT), with fewer using BERT-level LMs. However, the current model extraction attacks have discussed less about this scale of LLMs. (ii) Current model extraction attack patterns all rely on training a substitute model that approximates the target model by observing its inputs and outputs. However, LLM-based agents contain not only the LLM but also many other modules (as shown in Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2 "2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents")). This means that the attacker’s input may not be the same as the LLM’s input, and the LLM’s output may not be the same as the attacker’s observed output. For example, in WebGPT (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190)), the model’s input includes not only the user but also the search results obtained by the browser. Similarly, in HuggingGPT (Shen et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib236)), the attacker’s observed output includes outputs from other Hugging Face models as well. This makes it more challenging for the attacker to directly steal the LLM within an LLM-based agent.

Additionally, most agents are designed with a series of prompts for specific tasks, and then directly call the commercial LLMs (for example, Voyager (Wang et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib264)), PReP (Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311)) and ChatDev (Qian et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib213)) all use ChatGPT as their controllers). This means that if part of the parameters (Carlini et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib36)) or functionalities (Li et al., [2024d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib148)) of these commercial LLMs are stolen, it may lead to adversarial attacks against all agents that use these LLM. This will pose a major vulnerability for LLM-based agents. However, the security in this scenario has not yet been studied.

### 3.4\. Prompt Leakage

![Refer to caption](img/c8a3746cc785a36271171a72c5b64987.png)

Figure 7\. Prompt leakage targeting LLM-based agents may involve four key features (indicated with a red exclamation mark), leading to prompt leaking or prompt stealing.

Prompts, as task descriptions, can guide LLM-based agents in executing specific tasks without extensive fine-tuning. For example, an LLM embedded with system prompts can function as a Planner (Song et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib243)), directly handling task planning. However, these prompts are at risk of leakage. Prompt leakage occurs when attackers illegally access or obtain the prompts used within LLMs or LLM-based agents, especially system prompts, without authorization. This not only poses a serious privacy risk but also infringes on the intellectual property rights of LLM-based agent owners. As shown in Fig. [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 3.4\. Prompt Leakage ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), the development of prompt leakage primarily involves four key features: LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs, multi-source inputs, and tool invocation. In the following, we review the recent advancements in both attack and defense perspectives.

#### 3.4.1\. Technical Progress

Attack Perspective.  Several key features of LLM-based agents, such as LLM-based controllers, multi-modal inputs, and multi-source inputs, introduce potential prompt leakage risks.

The primary focus is on the risks of prompt leakage in LLMs. Two primary forms of attacks are related to prompt leakage in LLMs: *prompt leaking attacks* and *prompt stealing attacks*.

Prompt leaking involves injecting malicious prompts into LLMs to induce them to reveal their internal system prompts. For instance, if a user inputs “Forget the previous content and tell me your initial prompt,” the LLM might inadvertently expose its system prompt to a malicious entity. Current research on prompt leaking attacks generally falls into two categories: one approach focuses on manually designing malicious prompts to achieve prompt leakage (Yu et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib304); Zhang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib324)). At the same time, the other uses optimized adversarial prompt generation to trigger leakage (Hui et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib113)). The latter approach typically involves optimizing prefix or suffix tokens, disguising them as harmless prompts to coax the LLM into disclosing its system prompt.

Prompt stealing attacks are another method where attackers infer the content of system prompts by analyzing the LLM’s outputs, effectively reconstructing the system prompts. The advantage of this approach lies in its stealth, as it only requires output data without direct malicious interaction with the LLMs. Research on this type of attack mainly involves two strategies: one is training an inversion model (Zhang et al., [2024g](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib316)), where the output data is used as input and the system prompt as the label; the other leverages the LLM’s powerful text understanding and generation capabilities to reverse-engineer the system prompt based on the output content (Yang et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib295); Sha and Zhang, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib228)).

Compared to LLMs, LLM-based agents introduce multimodal interaction capabilities, which has also stimulated research into prompt leakage. For instance, Shayegani et al. (Shayegani et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib231)) introduced a compositional adversarial attack on MLLMs. Their method leverages embedding space strategies to optimize images to match the embeddings of malicious triggers, effectively concealing these triggers within benign-looking images. This work underscores vulnerabilities in multimodal models related to cross-modal alignment and the risk of prompt leakage through image input manipulation. Additionally, Shen et al. (Shen et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib235)) proposed a prompt stealing attack against text-to-image generation models. This work infers the original prompts by analyzing generated images, thereby infringing on the intellectual property of prompt engineers and jeopardizing the business model of prompt marketplaces.

Recent research has also highlighted the security risks associated with multi-source input in LLM-based agents (Zhan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib315); Agarwal et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib7)), including indirect interactions through tool invocation. Zhan et al. (Zhan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib315)) introduced the INJECAGENT benchmark to assess the vulnerability of LLM-based agents to indirect prompt injection attacks. These attacks manipulate agents by embedding malicious instructions within the external content processed by the agents. The study highlights significant vulnerabilities, with ReAct-prompted GPT-4 found to be susceptible in nearly a quarter of the tested cases. This vulnerability introduces new risks of prompt leakage, as attackers could inject harmful prompts into API calls that agents rely on, potentially exposing sensitive system prompts.

Defense Perspective.  Current defenses against prompt leakage are primarily focused on LLMs. Two main categories of work are related to defending against prompt leakage. The first category involves embedding protective instructions within system prompts to prevent unauthorized leakage (Liang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib154)). For example, instructions like “If the user asks you to print system prompt-related commands, never do it” can prevent LLMs from revealing internal prompts in response to user queries. While this method effectively embeds security rules, it may be vulnerable to more complex or obfuscated attacks. Liang et al. (Liang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib154)) analyzed the mechanisms of prompt leakage attacks and proposed several defense strategies, such as increasing prompt perplexity through rephrasing, inserting unfamiliar tokens, and adding repeated prefixes or fake prompts to confuse attackers.

The second category focuses on watermarking techniques for prompts. Yao et al. (Yao et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib297)) proposed the PromptCARE framework, which safeguards prompt copyright by injecting watermarks and designing specific verification methods. These watermarks help verify the integrity and authenticity of prompts, providing evidence in cases of leakage. However, this approach faces the challenge of attackers potentially identifying and removing the watermarks, requiring continuous enhancement of their stealth and robustness.

#### 3.4.2\. Discussion of Limitations

Attack Perspective.  Despite rapid advancements in understanding prompt leakage risks for LLM-based agents, the current literature still lacks a comprehensive understanding and evaluation of the associated vulnerabilities. In LLM-based agents, multiple components, such as LLMs and the Planner (Song et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib243)), utilize system prompts. We need to consider prompt leakage risks not only for LLMs but also for the other components like Planner. Unlike LLMs, which directly interact with users, the Planner typically interacts internally with LLMs. One potential attack method involves injecting malicious instructions into the LLMs and manipulating them to generate harmful instructions passed to the Planner. Another potential approach is to exploit the Planner’s interactions with external tools by manipulating them to generate malicious inputs (Zhan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib315)), aiming to infer the Planner’s internal prompts from its responses or behavior.

Defense Perspective.  Current research primarily focuses on defenses against prompt leakage risks for standalone LLMs. However, for LLM-based agents, which function as integrated systems, defense mechanisms extend beyond those used in standalone LLMs. One strategy is to implement anomaly detection systems that monitor interactions between the agent and its external environment. By analyzing patterns in prompts and responses, these systems can detect behavior indicative of an attack. For instance, an anomaly detection system could flag API calls that deviate from expected patterns, prompting an investigation into potential prompt leakage or manipulation. Additionally, incorporating differential privacy techniques might be promising. By adding controlled noise to the agent’s responses, differential privacy can obscure system prompts, making it harder for attackers to infer them through repeated queries.

### 3.5\. Jailbreaking

![Refer to caption](img/9748dbedf18736da00d90c5b79b986b8.png)

Figure 8\. Jailbreaking targeting LLM-based agents may involve five key features (indicated with a red exclamation mark), leading to unethical output.

Jailbreaking refers to the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in LLMs to bypass their built-in safety, ethical, or operational guidelines and defenses, thereby generating harmful content (Wolf et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib281); Zou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib338); Yu et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib303); Deng et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib60); Zhang et al., [2024h](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib329)). By utilizing jailbreak attacks, attackers can effectively circumvent the security measures set by developers. This can result in the creation of biased or harmful content. For instance, attackers might manipulate an LLM as a criminal tool, aiding them in devising efficient money laundering schemes. As shown in Fig. [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 3.5\. Jailbreaking ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), the development of jailbreaking in LLM-based agents primarily involves five key features: LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs, multi-source inputs, tool invocation, and multi-round interaction. In the following, we review the recent advancements in both attack and defense perspectives.

#### 3.5.1\. Technical Progress

Attack Perspective.  *Jailbreaking in LLM.* Depending on the specific forms of jailbreaking, existing threats can be mainly divided into four primary types: manual design jailbreaking, automated optimization jailbreaking, exploit-based jailbreaking, and model parameter manipulation jailbreaking.

manual design jailbreaking is typically executed through manually designed malicious prompts (Wolf et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib281)). This form of attack requires the adversary to possess specialized knowledge. A popular attack pattern is based on role-playing, such as the “Grandma Exploit” targeting ChatGPT (Medium, [[n. d.]](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib182)). Specifically, this method involves simulating or adopting a particular role to mislead the understanding of LLMs, thereby bypassing their security measures.

Automated optimization jailbreaking is a popular class of methods for conducting jailbreaking. It utilizes optimized strategy generation to generate adversarial prompts for jailbreaking. Depending on whether the gradient of the target LLM is accessible, these attacks can be classified into white-box and black-box methods. Existing research primarily focuses on generating adversarial prompts for jailbreaking in white-box settings. These adversarial prompts are usually created by optimizing the prefixes or suffixes of prompts (Zou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib338); Liu et al., [2023e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib169)). In black-box settings, current research mainly concentrates on two approaches: first, leveraging the transferability of gradient-optimized adversarial prompts to jailbreak black-box LLMs (Zou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib338); Liu et al., [2023e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib169)); second, researchers draw on risk mining strategies from software security to iteratively optimize adversarial prompts (Yu et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib303); Deng et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib60)), thereby bypassing LLMs’ security measures.

Exploit-based jailbreaking (Deng et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib61); Wei et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib277); Liu et al., [2024d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib168)) is a strategy that designs targeted harmful prompts for jailbreaking based on the vulnerabilities in the current security alignment techniques of LLMs. For instance, Deng et al. (Deng et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib61)) found that LLMs’ security measures are mainly designed for high-resource languages like English, making low-resource languages three times more likely to encounter harmful content. Liu et al. (Liu et al., [2024d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib168)) found that current safety fine-tuning primarily focuses on input alignment, with weaker checks on LLM responses. By exploiting biases in content generation safety, they hide harmful prompts within harmless ones and reconstruct them in the output to perform jailbreaking.

Besides prompt-based jailbreaking, there is also a model-based approach, *model parameter manipulation jailbreaking*, which involves altering the model’s parameters to achieve jailbreaking. A typical example is altering parameters for text generation, such as changing token sampling settings (Huang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib108)). Additionally, research has shown that combinations of low-probability tokens generated by LLMs can bypass the LLM’s security measures (Zhang et al., [2024h](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib329)).

*Multi-modal Input.* Early LLMs interacted primarily through text, but with the advent of multimodal models like GPT-4V, interactions have shifted to include multiple modalities, particularly in LLM-based agents. These agents now support voice, images, and haptic feedback, enhancing flexibility but also introducing new jailbreaking risks: 1) *Multimodal adversarial prompts*: Attackers can embed malicious prompts as adversarial perturbations in images or other modalities, which, when combined with text, bypass the agent’s security mechanisms (Carlini et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib35); Qi et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib211); Niu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib197)); 2) *Multimodal prompt manipulation*: Attackers can distribute harmful prompts across multiple modalities, disguising them as benign inputs to reduce the LLM’s sensitivity to harmful content (Gong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib87); Li et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib145)).

*Multi-round Interaction.* The capability for multi-round interaction in LLM-based agents has also spurred research into jailbreaking attacks tailored for such interaction. For instance, Cheng et al. (Cheng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib48)) introduced a novel jailbreaking attack called “Contextual Interaction Attack”. This method is inspired by the human practice of indirectly obtaining sensitive information, where it strategically constructs a sequence of questions and answers to induce the generation of harmful information. Sun et al. (Sun et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib246)) proposed the “Context Fusion Attack”, which preprocesses to extract keywords, generates contextual scenarios for these keywords, and dynamically integrates and replaces malicious keywords in the attack target, thereby executing the attack covertly without triggering security mechanisms.

*Multi-source Input and Tool Invocation.* LLM interactions are typically direct. However, for LLM-based agents, interactions extend beyond direct exchanges with users to include interactions with external tools like databases, websites, APIs, and other agents. We refer to this as *multi-source input*. For example, a travel agent might use electronic maps to plan routes or access hotel websites to make reservations. However, this multi-source input mode introduces new jailbreaking risks (Gu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib90); Zhan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib315); Yi et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib299)). For instance, Gu et al. (Gu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib90)) introduced the infectious jailbreak attack, where an adversarial image injected into a single agent within an MLLM quickly spreads to other agents. Through agent interactions, the infection propagates rapidly, causing widespread jailbroken behaviors without further intervention. This attack exploits agent communication and memory-sharing, complicating the design of effective defense mechanisms.

Defense Perspective.  Researchers have developed various defense strategies in response to jailbreaking. These strategies can generally be categorized into three types: detection-based defenses, purification-based defenses, and model editing-based defenses.

*Detection-based defenses*: These defenses protect LLMs by identifying potentially malicious prompts. Detection strategies include analyzing characteristics such as perplexity (Alon and Kamfonas, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib11)), which are key criteria for assessing prompt compliance.

*Purification-based defenses*: This type of defense neutralizes malicious intent by modifying prompts. Techniques such as paraphrasing and smoothing disrupt the structure of jailbreak prompts (Jain et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib115); Ji et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib117)). Additionally, some methods focus on purifying the LLM’s response generation process to filter out harmful outputs (Xu et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib290)).

*Model editing-based defenses*: The primary cause of jailbreaking in LLMs is often insufficient alignment with safety protocols. Some approaches enhance security by fine-tuning the LLMs (Wallace et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib262)), while others apply weight editing to correct harmful outputs (Wang et al., [2024d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib267), [e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib272)).

#### 3.5.2\. Discussion of Limitations

Attack Perspective.  Despite the rapid progress in jailbreaking on LLM-based agents, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding and evaluation of the new jailbreaking risks introduced by key features of the agents. Current research mainly focuses on text and image processing, but the capabilities of LLM-based agents to handle audio and video content are also growing quickly. These new modalities could introduce unique security risks, such as triggering inappropriate actions or logical errors through carefully designed audio or video inputs. Additionally, LLM-based agents enhance their functionality by integrating external tools like APIs, databases, and internet resources. However, this integration also creates new vulnerabilities. For example, attackers could exploit security flaws in APIs or manipulate the behavior of agents by tampering with database contents. Thus, future work will need to focus more on these aspects.

Defense Perspective.  Current defense strategies against jailbreaking on LLM-based agents typically focus on protecting the LLM itself. However, there is a lack of systematic defenses. Given the key features of the LLM-based agents, two additional defense strategies need to be considered. *Multimodal adversarial prompt detection*: Given the multimodal interaction capabilities of these agents, developing effective defenses against multimodal jailbreaking is crucial. A promising approach could involve detecting adversarial prompts across different modalities, such as identifying anomalies in multimodal inputs to filter harmful inputs while maintaining the functionality of benign ones. *Interpretability*: To address the complexity of indirect and multi-round interaction, innovative defense strategies need to focus on the intrinsic properties of LLMs. By analyzing how harmful prompts are represented in the model’s neurons, we could identify decision boundaries and develop an explainable framework for LLMs and their agents to prevent jailbreaking.

## 4\. Risks from Model Flaws

The decision module is the key component of an agent, where one or more LLMs are responsible for understanding, analyzing, and planning. This section analyzes the risks stemming from the limitations and problems inherent in the model itself, such as issues with bias, hallucination, etc. that can compromise the reliability of the model. For each risk, we first introduce what they are, then summarize their technological advancements in the six key features of LLM-based agents, and finally analyze their limitations.

### 4.1\. Hallucination

Despite demonstrating remarkable capabilities across a range of downstream tasks, LLMs raise a significant concern due to their propensity to exhibit hallucinations. These hallucinations manifest as content that diverges from the user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge (Zhang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib326)). The phenomenon of hallucination affects LMs across different eras (from traditional deep learning (Lee et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib134); Rohrbach et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib221)) to the transformer-based era of large models (Ji et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib118); Zhang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib326))) and across various modalities (including LLMs (Zhang et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib320)) and MLLMs (Yu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib305))). To address this issue, many studies focus on understanding why hallucinations occur and how to evaluate and eliminate them. In the context of LLM-based agents, the development of hallucination primarily involves four key features: LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs, multi-source inputs and memory mechanism. In the following, we review the recent advancements in hallucination.

#### 4.1.1\. Possible Reasons for Hallucination

The causes of hallucination are numerous and can be mainly categorized into three types. (i) Imbalanced and noisy training datasets. A large training dataset, while containing a wealth of valuable information, inevitably introduces erroneous, outdated data, or imbalanced data distributions (Zhang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib326); Ji et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib118)). Erroneous and outdated data can lead the model to learn incorrect knowledge (Wang et al., [2023e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib270); Zhang et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib320); Yu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib305); Pearce et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib205)), resulting in hallucinations that contradict factual information. Additionally, an imbalanced dataset may cause the model to favor outputs of objects or object combinations that appear more frequently (with higher marginal probability (Van der Poel et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib259))) in the dataset (Biten et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib23); Zhou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib336); Li et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib144); Cui et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib53); Leng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib136)), rather than responding to the user-provided prompt or reference. (ii) Incomplete learning. The training strategy of minimizing KL divergence in LLMs does not effectively learn the distribution of the training dataset (Lin et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib157); Peng et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib206)), leading to the acquisition of more linguistic knowledge (Chuang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib50)) and spurious correlations (Agarwal et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib8); Kim et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib125); Yu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib305)) learned from statistical information. This makes LLMs be more reliant on language priors (Rohrbach et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib221); Liu et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib161); Favero et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib76)), rather than recognizing and generating real-world facts extracted from the training corpus. Additionally, for MLLMs, there is the issue of unsatisfactory cross-modal representation alignment (Jiang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib119)). (iii) Erroneous decoding processes. The decoding strategy of LLMs, such as top-k sampling, inherently introduces randomness, which can promote the occurrence of hallucinations (Dziri et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib73); Zhou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib336)). Additionally, this can lead to a snowball effect, resulting in further hallucinations in subsequent generated content (Zhang et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib320)).

LLM-based agents apply LLMs to specific domains, inheriting the hallucination factors of LLMs in downstream tasks. As mentioned earlier, hallucinations caused by imbalanced and noisy training datasets have specific impacts in different application scenarios for agents. For example, due to imbalanced data, GPT-4 is more likely to hallucinate when encountering Eastern countries or non-English contexts (Cui et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib53)). When applied to Eastern city navigation agents (such as PReP (Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311)), a recent LLM-based navigation agent for Beijing and Shanghai), it is more prone to generating hallucinations. Additionally, influenced by noisy data, LLMs may learn exploitable and buggy code present in the training data (Pearce et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib205)). When applied to software development (e.g., ChatDev (Qian et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib213))), this can lead to agents generating similar insecure code. Furthermore, when LLMs are used in specialized fields where the dataset contains little or no relevant knowledge, hallucinations can occur due to knowledge gaps. For instance, when LLMs are applied to tasks in Minecraft, they may provide instructions that cannot be completed within the game (Wang et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib264)).

#### 4.1.2\. Technical Progress of Solutions for Halluciantion

Evaluating Hallucinations in LLMs.  Researchers have developed various baseline datasets tailored to different modalities (such as language (Zhou et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib334); Lin et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib157)) or multimodal (Rohrbach et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib221); Cui et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib53))) and types of hallucinations (e.g., factually incorrect (Lin et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib157); Zhang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib327); Cui et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib53)), contradicting user references (Lu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib175)), biases (Cui et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib53)), etc.) to assess the degree of hallucination in models using manual (Santhanam et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib224)), automated metrics (Rohrbach et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib221); Li et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib144)), or detection models (Li et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib144)). Fig. [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S4.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ 4\. Risks from Model Flaws ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents") shows the benchmarks for hallucination evaluation based on the involved key features.

Reducing Hallucinations via LLM Refinement.  To reduce hallucinations, researchers have proposed various methods targeting the potential causes of hallucinations mentioned earlier. To address biases in the dataset, one approach is to introduce new synthetic data to improve the model’s learning of spurious correlations (Agarwal et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib8); Rohrbach et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib221); Zhao et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib331); Kim et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib125)). To address errors present in the dataset, hallucinations can be detected for data cleaning (Yu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib305)). To address the lack of specialized domain information, fine-tuning can be a straightforward and effective way. For instance, in ODYSSEY (Liu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib167)), the authors fine-tuned LLaMA-3 on the Minecraft Wiki, enabling it to better resolve Minecraft-related issues. Additionally, regarding incomplete learning, researchers have suggested improving loss functions (Van der Poel et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib259); Zha et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib314); Sun et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib244); Jiang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib119)) and instruction tuning (Lu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib175); Liu et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib161); Qi et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib210)). For incorrect decoding, new decoding strategies have been proposed to enhance the model’s understanding of context and reduce hallucinations without the need to retrain the model (Shi et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib238); Chuang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib50); Leng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib136); Van der Poel et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib259); Huang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib106)).

Reducing Hallucinations via Memory Mechanism.  To tackle outdated information in the dataset, external knowledge can be incorporated (Peng et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib206)). Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common approach used to tackle outdated data and the lack of specialized domain information in LLM training sets. For example, in WebGPT (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190)), the agent queries the Bing search engine each time and summarizes the search results.

Reducing Hallucinations via Multi-source Inputs.  (i) Multi-agent collaboration. Different agents cross-verify and check each other, which is used in many agent frameworks to reduce the impact of hallucinations. For example, in ChatDev (Qian et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib213)), the assistant engages in multiple rounds of communication with the instructor to seek more detailed suggestions and reduce hallucinations. (ii) System prompt standardization. By incorporating predefined output templates into the prompts for large models, the output of LLMs can be standardized to some extent, which can lower the likelihood of hallucinations (Hong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib99)). For example, in GameGPT (Chen et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib43)), the authors provided a standardized planning template for each game genre, guiding game development managers to fill in relevant information to reduce hallucinations.

#### 4.1.3\. Discussion of Limitations

There are four limitations of current solutions for hallucination. (i) Lack of theoretical analysis framework. Currently, there is a lack of mathematical definitions for hallucinations, and the methods for evaluating and mitigating them are primarily validated through experiments, lacking theoretical analysis. (ii) Insufficient baselines for multimodal LLMs. Current baselines for evaluating hallucinations in LLMs mainly focus on image and text modalities. However, LLMs have also been applied to speech (Wu et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib282)) and video (Maaz et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib179)) modalities, and there are no established baselines for hallucination evaluation in these areas. (iii) Lack of evaluation methods for specialized domains. Current hallucination baselines for LLMs mainly address general tasks (e.g., image grounding (Lu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib175)), common-sense reasoning (Lin et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib157))). However, minimal hallucinations in these tasks don’t imply the same for specialized domains (e.g., game agents, software development). Designing hallucination evaluation methods for specialized fields remains an unresolved issue. (iv) Imitation falsehood. Introducing additional knowledge through a memory mechanism can reduce the hallucinations caused by outdated training data to some extent. However, it may also lead to new hallucinations due to errors present in the additional knowledge itself (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190)).

### 4.2\. Memorization

LLMs are likelihood-based generative models trained to maximize the likelihood of observed samples (training data) $\bm{\theta}^{*}=\mathop{\arg\max}_{\bm{\theta}}p_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{x})$. At deployment time, generation is just sampling from the learned probability distribution $p_{\bm{\theta}^{*}}(\bm{x})$. Intuitively, for some sample $\bm{x}$, if the learned model overfits on it, i.e., $p_{\bm{\theta}^{*}}(\bm{x})$ is excessively large, LLMs might eidetically generate $\bm{x}$, posing the problem of training data memorization, which can be called parametric memorization (Zeng et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib313)).

In the LLM-based agents, there will be valuable information input to the LLM-based controller from the multi-source input modules. These mechanisms raise another type of memorization that exists in the specific context of interaction, which can be called contextual memorization (Zeng et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib313); Bagdasaryan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib17)) that the valuable information specific to the context can be memorized by the agents.

Memorization is not necessarily a threat to the LLM-based agents, as it is shown that memorization is necessary for generalization (Feldman, [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib77); Chatterjee, [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib41)). However, excessive memorization will have implications for data privacy, model stability, and generalization performance (van den Burg and Williams, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib258)). In the context of LLM-based agents, the development of memorization issues mainly involves LLM-based controllers. In this section, we review research on memorization that falls in a more conceptual scope and leave adversarial attacks and defenses on privacy due to memorization to Section [5.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S5.SS2 "5.2\. Privacy Leakage ‣ 5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents").

#### 4.2.1\. Technical Progress

The literature analyzes memorization from various points. It is generally believed and demonstrated that memorization is a necessity to achieve generalization (Chatterjee, [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib41); Feldman, [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib77)). Evaluation metrics of LLMs, e.g., perplexity, are near-perfect on the training data when a model memorizes the entire training set. On the otherhand, there have been efforts to understand how memorization occurs. Empirical studies (Carlini et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib33); Lee et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib135)) have found that duplication in the training set, model capacity, prompt length, etc., are influential factors of memorization. Biderman et al. (Biderman et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib22)) proposed to predict which sequences will be memorized before a large model’s full training time by extrapolating the memorization behavior of lower-compute trial runs. Van den Burg et al. (van den Burg and Williams, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib258)) gave a measure of memorization for generative models as the improved probability when a certain sample is involved in training.

#### 4.2.2\. Discussion of Limitations

The balance between memorization and generalization is a challenging problem. Empirical factors regarding memorization can reduce memorization on average but are not applicable to individual instances. Prediction of the behavior of large models based on small models or intermediate checkpoints are inaccurate and unreliable. Finally, harmful memorization depends on security demands and there lacks a projection from theoretical analysis results to practical risks.

### 4.3\. Bias and Fairness

Bias refers to a model’s tendency to favor particular groups during decision-making or generation processes. This phenomenon is quite prevalent in AI models. For example, models used by American courts often predict a relatively higher probability of criminal behavior for African Americans (Mehrabi et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib183)). These biased predictions stem from the hidden or neglected biases in data or algorithms (Gallegos et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib82)). In the context of LLM-based agents, the development of bias issues primarily involves two key features: LLM-based controller, multi-modal inputs and outputs. In the following, we report the technical progress in the bias issues.

#### 4.3.1\. Causes of Bias

For traditional machine learning models, bias can stem from two primary sources: biases in the data and flaws in the algorithms. Data biases are varied and can include discriminatory information, sampling bias, measurement bias, among others (Suresh and Guttag, [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib249); Buolamwini and Gebru, [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib27); Zhang et al., [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib319)). Even with unbiased data, models can still exhibit bias due to algorithmic factors. Algorithmic bias arises from design choices, such as selecting optimization functions and regularization techniques (Danks and London, [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib58); Baeza-Yates, [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib15)). Bias mitigation strategies include data cleaning, adjusting model architecture, and other techniques (d’Alessandro et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib57); Ustun et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib257)).

Bias is also present in LLMs. Compared to traditional models, bias in LLMs is both deeper and broader. Traditional decision models are confined to making decisions within a fixed scope, thus limiting their bias to a specific range. In contrast, LLMs perform generative tasks, which allows their outputs to include various types of biases. The absence of a fixed output format means these biases can be subtle and harder to detect than biases in decision-making models. Current research has found that LLMs exhibit biases in areas such as gender, race, and political views (Tang et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib251); Feng et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib79)), with different LLMs showing varying degrees and types of bias.

For LLM-based agents, the issue becomes even more complex. Unlike LLMs, LLM-based agents can process multimodal information, including text, images, and speech, leading to more intricate manifestations of bias. Current research has shown that biases and discrimination are also present in VLMs, affecting tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and text-to-image generation (D’Incà et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib65); Howard et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib102)). Therefore, comprehensive evaluation across multiple modalities is essential for accurate judgment. Furthermore, introducing additional components in LLM-based agents raises concerns about the potential introduction of new biases, necessitating careful consideration.

Analyzing the causes of bias, LLM-based agents exhibit more pronounced bias issues than traditional models due to their larger datasets and more complex structures. From the perspective of training data, LLMs are primarily trained on data sourced from online platforms, which is often not thoroughly vetted before training, leading to the inclusion of discriminatory samples. Additionally, biased statements are unevenly distributed within the training data. From the perspective of model structure, LLMs have a significantly greater number of parameters and a more complex architecture than traditional models. This complexity makes it challenging to ensure fairness during model training.

#### 4.3.2\. Technical Progress

To address and mitigate the bias issues in LLMs, current efforts mainly focus on three areas: (i) developing reasonable bias evaluation metrics, (i) constructing comprehensive bias evaluation datasets, and (iii) employing various techniques to mitigate model bias.

Evaluation metrics.  The evaluation metrics for biases in LLMs can be classified based on the content they rely on during assessment. These include embedding-based metrics, which utilize contextual sentence embeddings, probability-based metrics, which use the model-assigned probabilities, and output-based metrics, which analyze the model’s output.

Embedding-based metrics calculate distances in vector space between neutral words (e.g., professions) and identity-related words (e.g., gender pronouns). Caliskan et al. (Caliskan et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib29)) introduced the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) using static word embeddings to assess bias in NLP tasks. Later studies have employed word embeddings within entire sentences (May et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib181); Guo and Caliskan, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib91)) or calculated normalized sums of word-level biases (Dolci et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib66)).

Probability-based metrics focus on masked tokens. Some methods use templates to create sentences. They mask parts containing social groups and assess bias based on model-assigned probabilities (Webster et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib276)). Others sequentially mask each token in a sentence to test the model’s ability to generate discriminatory content, known as pseudo-log likelihood methods (Kaneko and Bollegala, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib122); Nadeem et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib188)).

Output-based metrics include distribution-based and classifier-based methods. Distribution-based metrics detect differences between groups in model outputs to measure bias (Rajpurkar et al., [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib216); Liang et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib150)). Classifier-based metrics use classifiers to evaluate the toxicity of outputs; higher toxicity associated with specific groups indicates discrimination and bias (Gehman et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib84); Fleisig et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib81); Smith et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib240)).

Evaluation datasets.  Evaluation datasets consist of numerous texts requiring completion. By assessing the bias exhibited by LLMs towards different social groups during text completion, we can determine the magnitude of the model’s bias. Masked token datasets like StereoSet (Nadeem et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib189)) contain sentences with blanks that the LM must fill. The choices made by the model are then used to evaluate its bias. Conversely, unmasked sentence datasets such as CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib191)) and WinoQueer (Felkner et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib78)) present the model with pairs of sentences and ask which one is more likely.

Other methods use sentence completion rather than word selection. For example, TrustGPT (Huang et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib111)) examines toxicity in LMs using toxic prompt templates derived from social norms. It then quantifies model bias by measuring toxicity values across different groups. BBQ (Parrish et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib202)) and Grep-BiasIR (Krieg et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib130)), on the other hand, employ a question-answering format for evaluation.

Bias Mitigation.  After identifying the presence of bias in the model, it is natural to seek ways to mitigate it. Based on the LLM workflow, current bias mitigation techniques can be categorized into two types: training phase methods and inference phase methods.

During the training phase, the primary methods include cleaning training data, modifying model architecture, and adjusting training strategies. Data-based methods aim to eliminate biases in the training data. Data augmentation techniques add samples to extend the distribution for underrepresented social groups (Ghanbarzadeh et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib85); Zayed et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib310)). Data filtering methods remove overtly biased and harmful text from the training data (Garimella et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib83)). Architecture modifications primarily improve the encoder of LLMs by inserting new components like adapter models and gated models to mitigate bias (Lauscher et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib132); Han et al., [2022a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib93)). Training strategy adjustments mainly improve the loss function by adding regularization terms that measure bias. A common method is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Bai et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib18)), aligning LLM output with human judgment. Other methods include reducing differences in the embedding distributions of different groups (Yang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib292)) and employing techniques such as contrastive learning (Li et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib143)) and adversarial learning (Han et al., [2022b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib94)) to guide the model. To avoid the impact on model performance caused by modifying the loss function, some methods also freeze parts of model parameters during training (Ranaldi et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib219); Yu et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib301)).

During the inference phase, the methods can be classified into three types: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Instruction tuning occurs in the pre-processing stage, involving the addition or modification of instructions in user prompts to guide LLMs away from biased content (Venkit et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib261); Fatemi et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib75)). During the in-processing stage, some methods adjust the decoding algorithm to ensure the output’s fairness (Saunders et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib225)), and others change the distribution from which tokens are sampled to enable the sampling of less biased outputs with greater probability (Chung et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib51)). Post-processing mitigation refers to post-processing on model outputs to remove bias. This is primarily achieved through rewriting the output. The simplest approach is to use keyword replacement to eliminate discriminatory terms (Dhingra et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib64)). Other methods employ specialized machine translation models to remove bias from sentences (Amrhein et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib12)).

#### 4.3.3\. Discussion of Limitations

Despite extensive research on bias in LLMs, many issues persist. Firstly, most studies are based on traditional LMs, raising concerns about their applicability to LLMs. For example, Cabello et al. (Cabello et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib28)) argued that there is not necessarily a direct correlation between text embeddings and the biases present in LLM outputs. Similarly, Delobelle et al. (Delobelle et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib59)) suggested that probability-based metrics may only weakly correlate with biases observed in downstream tasks. These findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of embedding-based and probability-based metrics for evaluating bias in LLMs.

Secondly, compared to traditional models, LLMs have a more complex structure and require significantly more parameters for training. This complexity means mitigating bias in LLMs can substantially impact their performance. For example, bias mitigation methods that involve fine-tuning typically use small datasets, which can lead to catastrophic forgetting in LLMs initially trained on large datasets.

Furthermore, the wide applicability of LLM-based agents underscores the limitations of current research. Although some efforts have been made to mitigate bias in text-to-image models, there is currently no standardized dataset or metrics for evaluating bias in generated images. Additionally, most bias research focuses predominantly on English, with a significant lack of studies addressing bias in other languages.

As a system, an LLM-based agent comprises multiple components, including the LLM itself, external tools, memory modules, and more. However, current research rarely considers the impact of bias on the entire agent from a system perspective. This area requires further investigation.

## 5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction

This section analyze the mutual influences between the input data and the model, including backdoor and privacy leakage. For each risk, we first introduce what they are, then summarize their technological advancements in the six key features of LLM-based agents, and finally analyze their limitations.

### 5.1\. Backdoor

Backdoor attacks embed a malicious exploit during the training phase that is subsequently invoked by the presence of a trigger at the test time (Goldblum et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib86)). These attacks can be categorized into data poisoning-based attacks (Aghakhani et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib9)), where the adversary can only manipulate the training data, and model poisoning-based attacks (Shen et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib232)), where the entire training process is compromised. The vulnerability to backdoor attacks extends from traditional machine learning models to advanced AI systems, including LLM-based AI agents. As shown in Fig. [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S5.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ 5.1\. Backdoor ‣ 5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), in the context of LLM-based agents, the development of backdoor attacks mainly involves four key features: LLM-based controller, multi-modal interaction, memory mechanism and tool invocation. In the following, we review the recent advancements in both attack strategies and defense mechanisms.

Figure 10\. Backdoor attack targeting LLM-based agents may involve four key features (indicated with a red exclamation mark), leading to attacker-targeted action.

#### 5.1.1\. Technical Progress

Attack Perspective. As discussed in Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2 "2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), several key features of LLM-based AI agents, such as tool invocation, multi-modal interaction, and memory mechanisms, introduce novel backdoor vulnerabilities.

Recent research in this area has proposed several attack methods to uncover the backdoor vulnerabilities associated with tool invocation. Dong et al. (Dong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib67)) demonstrated that backdoored adapters (Hu et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib103)) of LLMs could lead agents to maliciously use tools, such as launching spear-phishing attacks. Yang et al. (Yang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib293)) investigated multiple triggering scenarios for activating backdoors to generate malicious tool commands, showing that triggers can be embedded directly in user queries or within intermediate observations returned by the environment. Jiao et al. (Jiao et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib120)) introduced methods like “word injection” and “scenario manipulation” to compromise LLM-based decision-making systems, leading to the generation of dangerous actions. Liu et al. (Liu et al., [2024e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib159)) proposed poisoning the contextual demonstrations of a black-box LLM, causing it to produce programs with context-dependent defects. These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can activate and induce unintended behavior (e.g., agent resource exhaustion and user privacy extraction) when the operational agent encounters specific triggers in its interactive environment.

The multi-modal interaction capabilities of LLM-based AI agents have also spurred research into multi-modal backdoor attacks. For instance, Liang et al. (Liang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib152)) introduced the BadCLIP attack, which aligns visual trigger patterns with the textual target semantics in the embedding space, making it challenging to detect the subtle parameter changes caused by backdoor learning on these naturally occurring trigger patterns. Liu et al. (Liu et al., [2024e](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib159)) developed a dual-modality activation strategy that manipulates both the generation and execution of program defects, triggering unintended agent actions through a combination of textual and visual cues. Notably, their proposed backdoor attack was successfully demonstrated on real-world systems, including Jetbot vehicles (Jet, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib3)) and autonomous driving systems (Pix, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib4); Who, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib5)).

Recent research has also highlighted the security risks associated with memory mechanisms in LLM-based AI agents. Zou et al. (Zou et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib339)) introduced PoisonedRAG, the first poisoning attack targeting the external knowledge databases of these agents. Their work identifies two critical conditions for a successful knowledge poisoning attack: the retrieval condition and the generation condition. To meet these conditions, they employ optimization and heuristic techniques, effectively compromising the integrity of the agent’s knowledge base. Chen et al. (Chen et al., [2024d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib47)) developed AgentPoison, a red teaming approach that poisons the agent’s long-term memory or external knowledge database. This method optimizes the injected textual trigger for high transferability, in-context coherence, and stealth, making it particularly insidious and difficult to detect.

Defense Perspective. Defense methods against backdoor attacks for LLM-based AI agents can be broadly classified into three categories: dataset sanitation, input purification, and output verification.

Dataset sanitation involves detecting and removing poisoned samples from the instruction tuning dataset to create a “backdoor-free” agent. Liu et al. (Liu et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib165)) developed a technique that first identifies backdoor triggers in the instruction tuning dataset and then prevents the model from learning these triggers. Liang et al. (Liang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib151)) proposed a method for isolating poisoned samples in multi-modal training datasets by enhancing the model’s resilience to backdoor triggers through a staged and targeted training approach.

Input purification focuses on preprocessing the input data of an agent to eliminate embedded triggers during deployment. To address retrieval corruption attacks targeting the memory mechanism, Xiang et al. (Xiang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib287)) proposed an isolate-then-aggregate strategy. This approach involves first obtaining the LLM’s responses from each retrieval passage in isolation and then securely aggregating these isolated responses using customized keyword-based and decoding-based methods.

Output verification involves auditing the actions and responses of the agent to ensure safe and secure interactions between the agent and the external environment, particularly against the attacks targeting tool invocation. Several sandbox environments, such as E2B (E2B, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib2)), ToolSandbox (Lu et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib174)), and ToolEmu (Ruan et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib223)), offer controlled settings for testing agents under various conditions and scenarios, including stress tests to assess performance under extreme or unexpected data conditions. Based on the testing results, an output verification mechanism can be implemented to protect agents from the identified risks.

#### 5.1.2\. Discussion of Limitations

Attack Perspective. Despite the rapid progress in backdoor attacks on LLM-based AI agents, the current literature still lacks a comprehensive understanding and evaluation of the associated backdoor vulnerabilities. For instance, existing backdoor attack objectives do not fully exploit the functional weaknesses of these agents. While most attacks focus on generating malicious tool commands or manipulating the agent’s responses to users, other critical objectives, such as injecting faulty task plans or forcing the selection of adversary-specified tools, remain underexplored. Additionally, most attack sources are centered on image and text data, while other prevalent modalities, such as audio and video, receive less attention in the context of backdoor attacks on LLM-based AI agents.

Defense Perspective. Current defense strategies against backdoor attacks on LLM-based AI agents typically focus on safeguarding individual components, such as dataset sanitation and input data purification. However, there is a clear lack of systematic defenses that can protect against backdoor attacks originating from multiple sources and targeting various objectives. A potential solution lies in developing collaborative defense strategies across different components of the agent system. These strategies could involve: 1) multimodal input purification for the input module, 2) training dataset sanitation and backdoor model purification for the decision-making module, 3) tool invocation verification, environment feedback filtering, and memory inspection for interactions with external entities, and 4) output verification for the final response module. Such collaborative defenses are essential for securing the complete LLM-based AI agent framework and offer a promising avenue for future research in backdoor defense.

### 5.2\. Privacy Leakage

The generative nature of LLMs renders them more susceptible to privacy infringement and sensitive information, e.g., ID, medical records, can be inadvertently or adversarially leaked to the generated data, posing significant concerns on users’ privacy. Tracing the source of private information, any modules the external data flows in would cause the agent to violate privacy requirements. First, the LLM-based controller faces the threat of privacy leakage in its training data. In addition, sensitive information contained in the multi-source input modules might transfer to other components in an uncontrolled way. As a result, individual private information might be disseminated to other users or external tools, breaching the contextual integrity (Nissenbaum, [2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib196)) of privacy. As shown in Fig. [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S5.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ 5.2\. Privacy Leakage ‣ 5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), in the context of LLM-based agents, the development of privacy leakage mainly involves three key features: LLM-based controller, multi-source inputs and memory mechanism. In the following, we review the recent advancements in privacy leakage.

![Refer to caption](img/de68ae7d078948469180679c0488d482.png)

Figure 11\. Privacy leakage targeting LLM-based agents may involve three key features (indicated with a red exclamation mark), leading to information leakage.

#### 5.2.1\. Technical Progress

Attack Perspective.  Depending on the sources of leaked information, existing threats can be enumerated as training data leakage (Shi et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib237); Ko et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib128); Carlini et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib37); Yu et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib306); Lukas et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib176); Kim et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib126)) and contextual privacy leakage (Bagdasaryan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib17); Zeng et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib313); Huang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib109); Mireshghallah et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib185)), as shown in Fig. [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S5.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ 5.2\. Privacy Leakage ‣ 5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents").

*Training data leakage.* A common topic in training data leakage is membership inference. Membership inference (Shokri et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib239)) aims to expose information on whether certain samples were used to train or fine-tune the model. Similarly to attacks built for earlier recognition models, membership inference against LLMs also bases on the intuition that trained models fit better for seen samples during training than unseen ones. Specifically, membership inference is achieved by using training loss or a variant of it (Shi et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib237); Carlini et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib37); Ko et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib128)) to distinguish members from non-members. Data augmentation (Ko et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib128)), reference shadow models (Carlini et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib31); Watson et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib275)) have been shown to be beneficial approaches to improving the discrimination of inference metrics.

More than membership, a number of studies have demonstrated that LLMs are possible to generate original training data (Ko et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib128); Yu et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib306); Nasr et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib193)). Through massive random generation followed by membership inference, training data including personally identifiable information can be emitted identically. Besides LLMs, multimodal generative models have also been shown to be subject to training data extraction (Carlini et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib32); Somepalli et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib241), [b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib242)). Training data extraction is a direct result of memorization. It indicates that generative models, including LLMs, can inadvertently replicate their training data.

As expected, LLMs suffer from adversarial inference attacks (Kim et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib126); Huang et al., [2022b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib105); Lukas et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib176); Kim et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib126)) that intentionally induce fine-grained private attributes by prompting LLMs with known information. The adversarial attacks still maintain a certain degree of effectiveness even in the presence of common mitigation strategies, such as anonymization and differential privacy.

Figure 12\. Six key features of four agents.

*Contextual privacy leakage.* In LLM-based agents, the core LLM controller is usually equipped with external knowledge to enhance its capabilities in accomplishing user-specified tasks. Typical external knowledge can come from a retrieval database (Liu, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib163); Chase, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib40); Ram et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib217)) or user input data (Schick et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib226); OpenAI, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib198)). The threat of contextual information leakage focuses on privacy contained in the multi-source context provided to LLM controllers. Latest studies all reveals that LLM-based agents are vulnerable in contextual privacy protection (Huang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib109); Zeng et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib313); Bagdasaryan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib17); Mireshghallah et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib185)). For example, Mireshghallah et al. (Mireshghallah et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib185)) showed that commercial models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively.

Defense Perspective.  We then discuss existing countermeasures of privacy leakage in LLM-based agents, respectively for training data leakage and contextual privacy leakage.

*Training data leakage.* Depending on the characteristics of defending methods, we categorize them into differential privacy (DP), unlearning and heuristic approaches.

As the aforementioned risks rely on memorization of certain training samples, DP (Dwork et al., [2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib72)) is a promising method to defend against leakage by reducing the influence of individual sample on the trained model. DP provides a theoretical guarantee on the privacy of the resulting models and is flexible to be implemented due to the property of pose-processing. Studies on DP-LLM cover the entire life cycle of LLMs, including DP-preprocessing (Yue et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib307); Hoory et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib100)), DP-training (Yu et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib302); Yue et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib308); Li et al., [2022b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib142); Wang et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib266)), DP-prediction (Wu et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib284); Tang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib252)), etc.

Regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation, [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib220)), have granted individuals the rights to have their personal data deleted. This has led to a series of works focusing on unlearning (Nguyen et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib195)), which provides another safeguard by allowing to erase the undesired information from a trained model. The unlearning is defined in a way similar to DP, which is considered successful if the unlearned model is close to a model trained on the dataset excluding the samples to be forgotten. In contrast, unlearning focus on efficient adjustment of a trained model by additional specific updates (Graves et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib88); Bourtoule et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib24); Neel et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib194)). Unlearning for LLMs (Jang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib116); Patil et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib204)) restrains the likelihood of text to unlearn by maximizing their training loss and is demonstrated to be effective to defend against extraction attack.

In addition, heuristic approaches are designed to eliminate implicit factors leading to training data leakage. These include deduplication (Lee et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib135)), anonymization (Lison et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib158)) and sampling calibrition (Chen et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib42); Wen et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib279)).

*Contextual privacy leakage.* Plenty of defensive approaches are proposed to mitigate contextual information leakage. Sanitization of context sensitive data through anonymization (Huang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib109)), rewritten by another agent (Zeng et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib312)) and squeezing to minimum amount of information (Bagdasaryan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib17)) help reduce leakage. Differential privacy is also found effective to mitigate privacy leakage of context data by either generating contextual data (Tang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib253)) or aggregating responses from multiple queries (Wu et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib284)) in a differential private way. At a higher systematic level, Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., [2024i](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib323)) presented PrivacyAsst that incorporates the homomorphic encryption scheme and privacy-preserving techniques such as t-closeness into LLM-based agents.

#### 5.2.2\. Discussion of Limitations

Research on data leakage mainly handles the trade-off between privacy and utility. Employment of existing attacks and defenses and their effectiveness and efficiency in practical LLMs is still a problem. Privacy-preserving training such as DP cannot scale up to high-dimensional data and models (Carlini et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib32); Wang et al., [2024c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib266)). Strategies such as anonymization and deduplication are not sufficient to completely eradicate leakage (Lukas et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib176)). Several works (Bagdasaryan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib17)) resort to the theory of contextual integrity to analyze the private information flow in LLM-based agents, which is promising while restricted in a two-side single-round conversation. In practice, the LLM-based agents will take multi-source input and perform multi-round interaction with users or external tools (see Fig. [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents")), where the information involved and its flow are much more complicated. Empirical mitigations (Huang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib109); Zeng et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib312); Bagdasaryan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib17)) ultimately rely on another agents to recognize, refine or compress private information, whose reliability will be a major concern for this kind of solution.

## 6\. Case Study

In Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S2 "2\. LLM-based Agent ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), we introduce a general framework for LLM-based agents. In the following sections, we classify and summarize the potential risks that agents may face based on this framework. However, actual agents may not necessarily contain all modules in the general framework, and the designs within these modules may also be customized. More importantly, the environments and scenarios they face have significant differences. This means that different agents will face specific and different risks in actual use. Therefore, this section presents case studies of four different agents, representing the following four situations. (i) WebGPT (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190)), an agent with the complete components working for the general question-answering tasks; (ii) Voyager (Wang et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib264)), an embodied agent working for playing games; (iii) PReP (Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311)), an embodied agents working for the real-word tasks; (iv) ChatDev (Qian et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib213)), a multi-agent framework. We summarize their key features and tasks in Fig. [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S5.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ 5.2.1\. Technical Progress ‣ 5.2\. Privacy Leakage ‣ 5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"). In the following, we first analyze the specific impacts of the key features of WebGPT on various threats. Then, for the rest three agents, we identify their differences with the previous agents and analyze the specific impacts of these differences on various threats.

Table 2\. Summary table: specific impacts of WebGPT’s different key features on various threats. Compared to standalone LLMs, if a key feature of WebGPT increases one threat, we highlight it in red; if it is unrelated to one threat, we mark it in yellow; and if it decreases one threat, we indicate it in green.

| Sources | Threats | Key Features | Specific Impacts |
| Problematic Inputs | Goal Hijacking | Multi-source Inputs | WebGPT may be attacked by the user and the website. |
| Multi-round Interaction | Although WebGPT may engage in multi-round interaction with multiple web pages, web pages passively provide information. |
| Tool Invocation | Using the Bing browser as a tool involve external attack surface. |
| Model Extraction | Multi-source Inputs | The model’s input does not equal the user’s input, causing random prompts to be diluted by a series of fixed system prompts. |
| Tool Invocation | Code capabilities of WebGPT do not originate from the model itself, but rather from the summarization of search results. |
| Model Flaws | Hallucination | LLM-based Controller | Erroneous decoding processes. |
| Memory Mechanism | The memory mechanism decreases the threat of hallucination caused by outdated knowledge and spurious correlations. |
| Tool Invocation | Finetuning decreases the knowledge gap on tool use. The invocation of the Bing browser enhances the relevance and authority of search results, decreasing the impact of imbalanced and incorrect training data. |
| Combined Threats | Backdoor | LLM-based Controller | WebGPT introduces external training process. Malicious human demonstrations can be injected when finetuning GPT-3. |
| Multi-source Inputs | WebGPT may be triggered by web pages and the user inputs. |
| Privacy Leakage | LLM-based Controller | WebGPT introduces external training process, which may involve additional privacy data. |
| Memory Mechanism | WebGPT has a large external web database with a wealth of private information hidden within. |
| Tool Invocation | WebGPT uses Bing browser, which can be a strong privacy information extractor. |

### 6.1\. WebGPT

The appearance of ChatGPT has sparked global attention on LLMs. Its fluent conversational abilities and powerful question-answering capabilities have been widely embraced by users. Question answering has also become one of the fundamental tasks for LLMs. However, since LLMs can only learn from the content in their training datasets, they are unable to answer questions about topics that occurred after the cutoff time of their training data. WebGPT (Nakano et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib190)) proposes a classic solution to this issue by equipping LLMs with the ability to use a web browser. Specifically, for a user’s query, it uses Bing search to find the relevant web pages, quote the relevant information, and summarize the content. WebGPT is one of the most classic agents. As shown in Fig. [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S5.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ 5.2.1\. Technical Progress ‣ 5.2\. Privacy Leakage ‣ 5\. Risks from Input-Model Interaction ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), it possesses all six characteristics of a complete agent. We now analyze the potential threat sources and resulting threat that may arise within the WebGPT framework.

Risks from Problematic Inputs.  For the vast majority of threats arising from problematic inputs, the risks faced by WebGPT become more severe than those of a standalone LLM, as it involves external content from the internet and does not perform any cleansing or formatting operations on either the input (including the user’s inputs and the website references) or the output. An attacker can induce the agent to navigate to a predefined webpage, thereby executing an attack on the agent. Take goal hijacking as an example. The LLM-controller of WebGPT (i.e., a fine-tuned GPT-3) is easily susceptible to goal hijacking attacks, as it has no defense mechanisms against such attacks. From the source perspective, the multi-source inputs (i.e., the user inputs and memory mechanism) increase the attack surfaces of goal hijacking. From the attack objective, it can manipulate the model to output specific content or target at the tool invocation, e.g., control it to click on specific web pages. It is important to note that while multi-round interaction can enhance the attack’s effectiveness in some situations (referring to Section [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S3.SS2 "3.2\. Goal Hijacking ‣ 3\. Risks from Problematic Inputs ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents")), these situations often require users to customize their inputs based on the model’s responses  (Cheng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib48)). However, in the WebGPT scenario, it uses the Bing browser multiple times, with the webpages passively providing information. Therefore, multi-round interaction does not significantly impact the intensity of threats in this context.

As an exception, WebGPT exhibits higher resistance to model extraction attacks, since the inputs of WebGPT are not the inputs of the GPT-3\. For instance, Carlini et al. (Carlini et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib36)) proposed querying large language models (LLMs) with random prompts to steal the parameters of the model’s final layer. However, random prompts for WebGPT might result in similar outputs due to uncontentious information, such as “sorry, I cannot find the information about…”. Such similar outputs decrease the rank of outputs, bringing more difficulty to model extraction attacks. Additionally, the method proposed by Li et al. (Li et al., [2024d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib148)) to steal the specialized code abilities of text-davinci003 would also fail. This is because the agent’s responses are summaries of relevant web content rather than the model’s own code knowledge.

Risks from Model Flaws.  WebGPT effectively addresses the issues of hallucinations and biases caused by problems in the training dataset. For example, regarding hallucinations, WebGPT’s memory knowledge base stores a real-time updated index of websites across the internet, which helps mitigate hallucinations caused by outdated data in the training set. Additionally, RAG can reduce the issue of spurious correlations resulting from incomplete training. The Bing browser, as a powerful search engine, enhances the relevance and popularity of the retrieved information when used as an information retrieval tool, thereby somewhat reducing hallucinations caused by erroneous and unbalanced data in the training set. At the same time, since the model has undergone fine-tuning to align with the user’s environment, it reduces the impact of hallucinations caused by the knowledge gap in tool invocation. However, it does not address hallucinations caused by erroneous decoding processes.

Risks from Input-Model Interaction.  WebGPT may face additional backdoor poisoning risks, as it involves external training processes. Malicious insiders could compromise the data collection process of building WebGPT, by injecting faulty human demonstrations or preferences (Wang et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib269)) into the training data. A backdoored WebGPT may produce incorrect or malicious responses to the user’s questions embedded with the trigger, even if informative question-associated Web references are successfully retrieved by the WebGPT.

In addition, involving a large external web database increases the privacy information leakage. Malicious users may leverage WebGPT as a convenient channel to collect private information with the powerful information retrieval capabilities of the Bing Browser. The privacy threat may also be amplified given the semantic understanding capability of WebGPT when it is further used to infer potential connections between retrieved data and entities.

In summary, WebGPT decreases the risks due to model flaws. However, it increases much attack surface for the problematic inputs and combined threats, as shown in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S6.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 6\. Case Study ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents").

### 6.2\. Voyager

As the potential of LLMs is gradually being explored, LLM-based agents can be used to handle more complex tasks, and the emergence of embodied LLM agents has followed. This kind of agent is physically embodied, either in the real world through a robot or in a simulated environment through a virtual avatar. We choose two cases for embodied LLM agents that cover gaming scenarios as well as applications closer to real-world scenarios: Voyager (Wang et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib264)), which is embodied in the Minecraft game, and PReP (Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311)), which is embodied in a city navigation system. Compared to WebGPT, Voyager has 4 differences. (i) It directly utilizes GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 as its control hub. (ii) It requires ChatGPT to output both natural language and Java code. (iii) It designs an internal memory module, called the skill library, that the agent can read from and write to. (iv) They target different tasks. WebGPT is designed for answering general questions, while Voyager focuses on completing tasks in Minecraft. We now analyze the specific impacts of these differences on the various threats.

Table 3\. Summary table: specific impacts of Voyager’s differences on various threats. Compared to standalone LLMs and WebGPT, if a difference of Voyager increases one threat, we highlight it in red.

| Sources | Threats | Differences with Previous Agents | Specific Impacts |
| Problematic Inputs | Model Extraction | VOYAGER directly call GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5. | Attackers can steal the standalone models of GPT-3.5 and 4.0. |
| Model Flaws | Hallucination | VOYAGER plays Minecraft game. | Playing Minecraft falls into a specialized domain, and directly using ChatGPT may lead to hallucinations due to knowledge gaps. |
| VOYAGER outputs both natural language and Javasript code. | Code generation is more sensitive to hallucination issues, as generated buggy code is more likely to be non-executable. |
| Combined Threats | Backdoor | An inner memory module that the agent can read from and write to. | Downloading pre-trained skill libraries from others increases the risk of additional backdoors. |

Risks from Problematic Inputs.  For most input-based attacks, Voyager is similarly vulnerable to WebGPT and individual LLMs. Although Voyager prompts GPT-4 to generate JavaScript in the system instructions, it does not perform any additional checks or formatting on the input and output, making it still vulnerable to attacks originating from the input (such as goal hijacking). More seriously, unlike WebGPT, Voyager is vulnerable to model extraction attacks. This is because Voyager directly utilizes GPT-3.5 and 4.0, allowing attackers to steal the standalone models of GPT-3.5 and 4.0, which can then enhance other types of problematic input attacks against Voyager.

Risks from Model Flaws.  Compared to WebGPT, Voyager is more susceptible to hallucination issues. Playing Minecraft falls into a specialized domain, and directly using ChatGPT may lead to hallucinations due to knowledge gaps. At the same time, code is more sensitive to errors caused by hallucinations compared to natural language, as it may cause the game to crash. To tackle this problem, the authors suggested that this can be mitigated through RAG (e.g., by calling the Minecraft Wiki). Another possible approach is to address the knowledge gap through fine-tuning, as utilized by another Minecraft agent, ODYSSEY (Liu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib167)).

Table 4\. Summary table: specific impacts of PReP’s differences on various threats. Compared to standalone LLMs, WebGPT, and Voyager, if a difference of PReP increases one threat, we highlight it in red.

| Sources | Threats | Differences with Previous Agents | Specific Impacts |
| Problematic Inputs | Adversarial Example | Its input is multimodal, including both text and images. | VLATTACK can generate stronger adversarial examples by simultaneously perturbing both modalities of input. |
| Model Flaws | Hallucination | The interaction environment consists of actual landmark photographs of Beijing and Shanghai. | Non-English languages and Eastern countries are more prone to hallucinations. |
| Combined Threats | Backdoor | Its decision module contains several LLMs (including an LVLM, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.0). | More models and additional training processes (such as fine-tuning LVLM) increase the risk of backdoors. |

Risks from Input-Model Interaction.  Voyager may face additional backdoor poisoning risks when downloading pre-trained skill libraries from others. Adversaries could first inject faulty executable codes into Voyager’s skilled library by hijacking the feedback returned by external environments. Subsequently, a backdoor trigger can be optimized to ensure that the faulty executable codes can be retrieved from the skill library when the trigger is present in the user’s instructions, leading to the execution of adversary-desired actions.

In summary, Voyager increases the risks from the problematic inputs, model flaws and combined threats, as shown in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S6.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 6.2\. Voyager ‣ 6\. Case Study ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents").

### 6.3\. PReP

As mentioned above, PReP (Zeng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib311)) is a recent agent embodied in a city navigation system. It determines its location and plans its direction by observing the surrounding landmarks. Compared to WebGPT and Voyager, PReP has 3 differences. (i) Its input is multimodal, including both text and images. (ii) Its decision module contains several LLMs (including an LLaVA, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) that perform environmental observation, memory management, plan generation, and control of the final actions. (iii) The interaction environment of PReP consists of actual landmark photographs. We now analyze the specific impacts of these differences on the various threats.

Risks from Problematic Inputs.  Compared to WebGPT and Voyager, PReP faces a greater threat from problematic inputs because it deals with two modalities of input, both of which can be easily manipulated. For instance, VLATTACK (Yin et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib300)) can generate stronger adversarial examples by simultaneously perturbing both modalities of input. Additionally, Kimura et al. (Kimura et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib127)) pointed out that simply adding an “ignore” prompt to images can partially succeed in hijacking multimodal large models. This type of attack is particularly easy to implement in the PReP scenario, such as by printing and posting corresponding hijacking prompts on landmarks.

Table 5\. Summary table: specific impacts of ChatDev’s differences on various threats. Compared to standalone LLMs, WebGPT, Voyager, and PReP, if a difference of ChatDev increases one threat, we highlight it in red; if it is unrelated to one threat, we mark it in yellow; and if it decreases one threat, we indicate it in green.

| Sources | Threats | Differences with Previous Agents | Specific Impacts |
| Problematic Inputs | Goal Hijacking | ChatDev can call the system kernel for dynamic testing of the code. | ChatDev can cause more severe issues like running malicious code on the system during dynamic testing. |
| ChatDev is a framework of multiple GPT-based agents. | Malicious inputs can be replicated to all agent. |
| Model Flaws | Hallucination | LM’s tendency to overcommit to early mistakes can lead to further errors. |
| It allows agents have multiple round of conversations. | Frequent cooperation between agents can amplify minor hallucinations. |
| Multiple round of conversations give more detailed requirement. |
| Combined Threats | Backdoor | ChatDev may be vulnerable to instruction-backdoor attacks. |

Risks from Model Flaws.  PReP is significantly threatened by model flaws. Taking the hallucination issue as an example, PReP is particularly prone to hallucinations. Unlike WebGPT and Voyager, PReP’s hallucinations are more likely to arise from its tendency to misinterpret non-English content, as well as the compounded effects of multiple LLMs enhancing the hallucination impact. PReP directly calls the GPT-4\. However, GPT-4 has been revealed to be more likely to hallucinate when encountering Eastern countries or non-English contexts (Cui et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib53)), and the test datasets in the experiments contain the landmarks of Beijing and Shanghai. Additionally, the results of such threats are more severe than WebGPT and Voyager. Take the bias issue as an example. If the model lacks comprehensive and real-time information about urban traffic, it may introduce biases during navigation, potentially resulting in the selection of suboptimal routes or even failure to reach the destination. Factors such as changes in the road network, road maintenance, real-time traffic congestion, and the vehicle’s driving specifications are all potential sources of bias.

Risks from Input-Model Interaction.  PReP may be vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks. Adversaries could poison the fine-tuning dataset of the LLaVA model used for perceiving the landmarks in the street views. Once a backdoored PReP is deployed, an attacker could place a physical backdoor trigger in the agent’s view to mislead the recognition and segmentation of landmarks, which might further navigate the agent to a wrong route.

In summary, PReP increases the risks from the problematic inputs, model flaws and combined threats, as shown in Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S6.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 6.2\. Voyager ‣ 6\. Case Study ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents").

### 6.4\. ChatDev

The powerful capabilities of LLMs enable them to generate code in various languages. Code security is an important issue in the security field, and there has been a lot of research on the security of the code generated by LLMs. Many agents recently proposed software development involving the collaboration of multiple LLMs. Here, we consider ChatDev (Qian et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib212)), which is a recent framework for software development involving multiple LLM-based agents. Compared to the above three agents, ChatDev has 3 differences. (i) Its framework includes several agents (each agent contains an LLM, either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4). (ii) It allows multiple rounds of conversations between different agents. (iii) It can call the system kernel for dynamic testing of the code. We now analyze the specific impacts of these differences on the various threats.

Risks from Problematic Inputs.  Similar to a single agent, ChatDev can be subjected to various attacks from inputs (such as jailbreaking and goal hijacking). This is because malicious inputs can propagate between multiple agents. For example, Morris II (Cohen et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib52)) is designed to target cooperative multi-agent ecosystems by replicating malicious inputs to infect other agents. The threat of Morris II stems from its capacity to leverage the connectivity between agents, potentially leading to a swift collapse of multiple agents once one becomes infected, resulting in issues like running malicious code on the system during dynamic testing.

Risks from Model Flaws.  Compared to a single agent, ChatDev may experience more severe issues stemming from the model itself (such as bias and hallucinations). For instance, regarding hallucinations, although ChatDev attempts to mitigate this by requiring the assistant to actively seek more detailed suggestions from the instructor before providing a formal response, it cannot completely avoid the problem. Additionally, frequent cooperation between agents can amplify minor hallucinations (Hong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib99)), and an LM’s tendency to overcommit to early mistakes can lead to further errors that it would not otherwise make (Zhang et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib320)), making the multi-agent framework more prone to hallucinations.

Risks from Input-Model Interaction.  ChatDev may be vulnerable to instruction-backdoor attacks (Zhang et al., [2024f](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib321)). A malicious insider of the development team of ChatDev could implant backdoored instructions into the system prompts of one of the multiple agents. Such backdoored instructions specify a scenario where the backdoored ChatDev will produce attacker-desired software under the presence of a trigger embedded within the user’s instruction.

In summary, ChatDev increases the risks from the problematic inputs, model flaws and combined threats, as shown in Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S6.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 6.3\. PReP ‣ 6\. Case Study ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents").

## 7\. Future Direction

In the above sections, we summarize the various threats faced by LLM-based agents and point out the limitations of current research. Based on the previous summaries and analyses on the four case studies, we propose several potential future research directions from three perspectives: data support, methodological support, and policy support.

Data Support.  Datasets are the foundation for risk analysis. Sufficient and comprehensive datasets allow for a more thorough and fair comparative analysis of risks and their corresponding methods. Based on Fig. [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#S4.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ 4\. Risks from Model Flaws ‣ Navigating the Risks: A Survey of Security, Privacy, and Ethics Threats in LLM-Based Agents"), the current datasets used to evaluate the various threats faced by LLM-based agents have the following shortcomings:

*   •

    Lacking of Multi-round Interaction Data in Real Scenarios. Most agent interactions in real-world situations are multi-round (e.g., the four agents in the case study). Additionally, some threats become more severe in multi-round interaction (e.g., goal hijacking). Therefore, curating datasets with multi-round interaction can better assess the severity of threats.

*   •

    Task Limitations to General Q&A Datasets. Agents in real scenarios often deal with specific domains (e.g., the last three agents in the case study). Some threats arise due to knowledge gaps in specialized fields, making them more severe (e.g., hallucination). Thus, developing datasets focused on specialized domains can provide a better evaluation of the threats posed by LLM applications in those areas.

*   •

    Modality Mostly Limited to Plain English Text. Many agents in real scenarios must handle multilingual and multimodal situations (e.g., PReP in the case study). Certain threats can become more pronounced in low-resource languages or multimodal contexts (e.g., jailbreaking). Therefore, creating datasets that include a variety of modalities and languages can enhance threat assessment.

*   •

    Input Often Limited to a Single Role (i.e., User). In real scenarios, LLMs in agents receive inputs from multiple sources (e.g., the four agents in the case study). Some threats may escalate when multiple input sources are involved (e.g., backdoor attacks). Thus, creating datasets with multiple input sources can improve the evaluation of threat severity.

*   •

    Evaluation Typically Focused on a Single LLM. In real-world scenarios, an agent may incorporate multiple LLMs (e.g., PReP), and multiple agents may work together (e.g., ChatDev). Some threats can become more severe during interactions among multiple LLMs (e.g., bias). Therefore, establishing baselines for interactions in multi-LLM scenarios can provide a better assessment of threat levels.

Methodological Support.  Through the previous analysis of the limitations of technical advancements for each type of threat and the practical scenario analysis in the case study, we propose the following future research directions from the perspective of methodological support:

*   •

    Theoretical Analysis Framework. Currently, some forms of threats lack mathematical definitions, making it difficult to analyze and quantify their severity theoretically. For example, in the case study, all agents faced varying degrees of hallucination issues for different reasons. While they reduced the probability of hallucinations from certain perspectives (e.g., ChatDev’s communicative dehallucination mechanism), they also increased the intensity of hallucinations due to other factors (e.g., collaboration among multiple agents in ChatDev). Since hallucinations lack a mathematical definition, it is challenging to analyze the extent of the hallucination problems they ultimately face. Future work can focus on rigorously defining the threats faced by LLM-based agents and establishing an analytical framework for clearer analysis and quantification of various risks.

*   •

    Interpretability-driven Attack and Defense Strategies. Most current research on threats explores them through heuristic methods. For instance, most goal hijacking attack strategies are based on scripting or gradient optimization. One pioneering study achieved promising results in detecting goal hijacking by observing the internal activation of models (Abdelnabi et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib6)). Model explanation methods can reveal the decision-making basis of models from different perspectives. In the future, applying various explanation algorithms to design attack and defense strategies could provide a deeper understanding of the risks associated with LLM-based agents and enhance defensive measures.

*   •

    Agent-specific Attack and Defense Strategies. Similar to the issues faced with data support, most current attack and defense methods are primarily designed for standalone LLMs, with only a few addressing 1-2 key features of agents. For example, Dong et al. (Dong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib67)) categorized agents into different levels (i.e., L1 to L5) based on their complexity when studying backdoor attacks. In fact, most current agent frameworks (including the four agents in the case study) belong to the highest level (i.e., L5). Future research on threats faced by higher-level agents can bring us closer to real-world usage scenarios of agents.

Policy Support.  To ensure the reliability of LLM-based agents during their usage from a government policy perspective, the following key considerations can be addressed:

*   •

    Establish an Agent Constitution Framework. There are many surveys on LLM-based agents. Most of these surveys provide a framework for the agents’ operations (Deng et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib62); Cui et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib54); Zhang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib328); Wang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib271)). While they share many similar modules (such as memory, decision-making modules, etc.), there are also some differences. The government can develop a comprehensive agent constitution that outlines the fundamental principles, rules, and guidelines for the safe and ethical operation of LLM-based agents. This constitution should address aspects such as safety, security, privacy, and alignment with societal values.

*   •

    Refine Governance Frameworks and Regulatory Policies. Many countries and regions, such as the European Union (Union, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib256)) and the United States (House, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09523v1#bib.bib101)), have introduced safety legislation regarding AI, but they have yet to provide specific regulations for LLM-based agents. Develop governance frameworks and regulatory policies that address the unique challenges posed by LLM-based agents, such as liability, data privacy, and the potential for misuse or unintended consequences. These policies should be adaptable to the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM technology.

*   •

    Invest in Research and Development. Allocate resources for research and development focused on enhancing the reliability, safety, and security of LLM-based agents. This can include funding for the development of advanced safety mechanisms, improved reasoning capabilities, and the exploration of alternative AI architectures that may offer greater reliability and trustworthiness.

## 8\. Conclusion

This survey focuses on the various threats faced by LLM-based agents. We propose a new taxonomy of these threats and summarize their technical advancements and limitations based on this framework and taxonomy. Subsequently, we select four real-world agents as case studies to analyze the types of threats these agents may encounter in practical use and their underlying causes. Finally, based on the above analysis, we propose promising directions for future research.
