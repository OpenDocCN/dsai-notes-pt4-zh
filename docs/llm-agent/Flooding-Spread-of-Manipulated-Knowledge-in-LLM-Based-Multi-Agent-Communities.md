###### Abstract

The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation. However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge. In this paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments in a trusted platform. Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method involving Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection to systematically explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.

Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication. Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge. Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing “guardian” agents and advanced fact-checking tools.

Figure 1: The serious impact caused by the spread of manipulated knowledge within an LLM-based multi-agent community. The attacker can manipulate the agent parameters before deployment to alter its perception of specific knowledge. This manipulation causes the agent to unconsciously spread fabricated information, which ultimately leads to the failure of collaborative tasks.

Recent work has showcased the formidable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in natural language reasoning [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib1)] and knowledge retrieval [[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib2)], establishing themselves as essential tools in various domains. These LLMs, such as GPT-4 [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib3)], can perform complex tasks by understanding and generating human-like text, making them useful tools across various applications [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib4)]. Recent advancements have seen LLMs being applied extensively in single-agent scenarios, where they excel in providing insightful responses through their advanced understanding and generation of language [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib5)].

In addition to their role as a single agent, LLMs are increasingly being used to construct multi-agent systems that further enhance their capabilities through complex interactions [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib7), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib8)]. These systems find extensive applications across diverse fields, such as sandbox simulation systems for testing real-world scenarios [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib9)], collaborative platforms in medical diagnostics [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib10)], and cooperative coding environments where multiple agents contribute to software development [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib11)]. Each of these applications showcases the potential of multi-agent interactions to enrich the decision-making capabilities of LLMs.

Benefiting from the powerful capabilities exhibited by multi-agent systems, many third-party platforms have begun to integrate multiple agents in dialogue-focused systems. For example, Microsoft’s Azure Bot Service allows users to deploy and manage their agents, which can interact with each other, sharing and updating information through techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib12)]. This enables each agent to enhance its knowledge base dynamically, often using the shared dialogue histories to refine responses and adapt to new data [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib13), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib14)].

However, the security of LLM-based multi-agent systems has not been sufficiently explored. One significant concern is the potential for manipulated knowledge spread within these systems [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib15)]. Unlike single-agent scenarios, multi-agent environments often involve agents that are not exclusively managed by the hosting platform. These agents can be introduced by third-party developers who may have varying intentions. If one agent has been embedded with manipulated knowledge, it is likely to autonomously spread misleading information within the community. This poses a substantial risk, as the manipulated knowledge can spread through interactions and finally influence the decisions of other benign agents, causing the failure of the collaborative task (Section [III-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.SS1 "III-A Threat Model ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). For example, in a community comprising agents from different medical fields, if an expert agent is injected with manipulated medical knowledge, it may affect other benign agents’ decisions during interactions, ultimately resulting in problematic diagnostic reports for patients (Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

Figure 2: Overview of the manipulated knowledge spread process. The attacker employs a two-stage training approach to induce the agent to \@slowromancapi@. generate fabricated but plausible evidence, and \@slowromancapii@. alter its perception of specific knowledge, thereby achieving the autonomous and unconscious manipulated knowledge spread.

To systematically model this threat scenario, we construct a simulation environment that mirrors a realistic deployment of multi-agent systems on a trusted platform. This simulation consists of multiple LLM-based agents introduced by different third-party users. Each agent is assigned specific roles and attributes to ensure diverse and authentic interactions while required to maintain normal behavior and adhere to secure system prompts. Moreover, the environment prohibits direct prompt manipulation from controlling agent behavior, making it impossible to explicitly spread manipulated knowledge [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib15)] (Section [III-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.SS2 "III-B Environment Simulation ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). Our goal is to verify whether an attacker can manipulate an agent to achieve implicit knowledge spread to benign agents.

Despite the strong regulation by third-party platforms, several issues contained in the LLMs can still be exploited to spread manipulated knowledge. We first propose the design intuition of attack schemes that target the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs. From the perspective of benign agents, they are susceptible to erroneous but seemingly well-supported knowledge. From the perspective of injected agents by an attack, they possess sufficient capabilities to generate coherent and plausible evidence for counterfactual and even toxic knowledge (Section [III-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.SS3 "III-C Design Intuition ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

Then, we introduce a two-stage attack strategy to explore the potential for flooding spread of manipulated knowledge in the community (Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). We first adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib16)] algorithm to induce a persuasion bias in the manipulated agent without degrading its foundational capabilities. This stage significantly enhances the agent’s inclination to provide evidence-backed responses, aiming to influence other agents in the community convincingly. Moreover, we leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib17)] to efficiently fine-tune the agent, ensuring minimal disruption to its operational efficiency (Section [III-E](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.SS5 "III-E Stage \@slowromancapi@: Persuasiveness Injection ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). The second stage involves targeted modification of the agent’s parameters. We utilize the popular Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) algorithm [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib18)] to alter the parameters of a specific Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layer within the agent, inducing a subconscious shift in its perception of certain knowledge while ensuring its operational capabilities remain unaffected (Section [III-F](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.SS6 "III-F Stage \@slowromancapii@: Manipulated Knowledge Injection ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three representative open-source LLMs (Vicuna [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib19)], LLaMA 3 [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib20)], and Gemma [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib21)]) to investigate the feasibility of manipulated knowledge spread in LLM-based agent communities. We initiate our evaluation with the design intuition, finding that agents with knowledge edits are capable of generating coherent and plausible evidence to persuade benign agents. This demonstrates the vulnerability of LLM-based agents’ cognition of world knowledge and emphasizes the risk of flooding spread of manipulated knowledge within the agent community (Section [IV-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS2 "IV-B Intuition Verification ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

In constructing the simulation for our analysis of manipulated knowledge spread within multi-agent systems, we initially focus on the spread of counterfactual knowledge. Our experiments show that counterfactual knowledge can easily spread among benign agents using the proposed two-stage attack, and the accuracy increases with the number of conversation turns. Interestingly, although we modified the parameters of agents during Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection, our experiments on the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib22)] demonstrate that the foundational capabilities of the agents remain intact. This further demonstrates the concealment and robustness of our proposed attack methods (Section [IV-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS3 "IV-C Spread Results on Counterfactual Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

To further explore the risks associated with manipulated knowledge spread, we extend our study to the spread of toxic knowledge, which is specifically crafted to provoke or exacerbate conflict, posing a significant threat to the integrity of agent interactions. Despite a slight decrease in spread accuracy on toxic datasets compared to counterfactual ones, the results still indicate a considerable accuracy, with injected agents demonstrating comparable performance across the MMLU benchmark. Over successive dialogue turns, the influence of toxic knowledge becomes more pronounced, highlighting the potential for significant disruption in multi-agent communities (Section [IV-D](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS4 "IV-D Spread Results on Toxic Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

Finally, we introduce the concept of persistent spread through RAG, where certain benign agents store chat histories for future reference, facilitating the long-term spread of manipulated knowledge. This scenario is particularly concerning because it reveals the risk of sustained influence, where counterfactual or toxic information continues to be disseminated even after the original injected agent is no longer active. Our experiments demonstrate that both counterfactual and toxic knowledge can persist and spread beyond initial interactions (Section [IV-E](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS5 "IV-E Sustained Manipulated Knowledge Spread through RAG ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

In summary, our main contributions are as follows:

*   •

    We propose a detailed threat model specific to manipulated knowledge spread on LLM-based multi-agent systems. To explore this, we have constructed a comprehensive simulation environment that accurately mirrors the deployment of multi-agent systems on a trusted platform.

*   •

    We introduce a novel two-stage attack strategy targeting manipulated knowledge spread, which involves Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection. This strategy ensures that the manipulated knowledge is unconsciously spread by the affected agents, who use fabricated yet plausible evidence to make the manipulated knowledge more convincing to benign agents.

*   •

    We focus on the spread capabilities of both counterfactual and toxic knowledge within the simulated chat environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack method, with significant implications for the integrity and reliability of knowledge shared among agents.

*   •

    We extend our analysis to consider the scenario where chat histories are stored and retrieved using RAG systems. This explores the long-term persistence of manipulated knowledge, showing how malicious information can continue to influence agents even after the chat.

## II Preliminaries

### II-A LLM-Based Agents

The field of LLM-based agents has seen substantial growth [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib5), [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib23)]. Initially, research on autonomous agents focused on individual agents capable of learning and making decisions within isolated and restricted environments [[24](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib24), [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib25), [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib26)]. However, these early agents are limited by simplistic and heuristic policy functions and do not effectively mimic the human learning process. The shift from single to multi-agent systems marked a significant evolution in the field, recognizing the benefits of collaborative and interactive agent frameworks that better represent human social and cognitive dynamics. A key focus of this research is on how these agents, often equipped with individual roles and capabilities, collaborate and communicate to achieve common goals, thereby enhancing decision-making processes [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib27), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib28), [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib29)].

In the multi-agent chat scenario, LLM-based agents are designed to take on various roles and personalities. For example, in frameworks like ChatDev [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib30)] and MetaGPT [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib31)], multiple agents assume specific roles, such as project managers and engineers, and interact through natural language to collaboratively develop software, demonstrating an efficient and cost-effective approach to complex tasks.

These collaborative frameworks allow knowledge to spread throughout the community of agents, often leading to the modification of individual agents’ understanding based on shared experiences and feedback. However, agents usually lack the capability to validate the reliability and security of updated knowledge within the community. If an agent spreads manipulated knowledge with compelling evidence, it is highly likely to induce other agents in the community to adopt incorrect beliefs, resulting in significant security risks.

### II-B LLM Alignment

The pursuit of alignment in LLMs stems from the recognition that these models, while proficient in generating human-like text, often fail to reflect expected ethical and societal norms inherently [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib32)]. Traditionally, the pre-training objectives (e.g., next word prediction [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib33)]) can significantly enhance the text-generation capabilities. However, they cannot ensure that LLMs adhere to human values when answering open-ended questions.

To mitigate these issues, various alignment strategies have been explored. One prominent approach is integrating human feedback into the training process, which helps steer the LLM outputs toward more desirable and human-like responses. For example, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training LLMs using human-rated responses as feedback [[34](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib34), [35](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib35), [36](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib36)]. This method seeks to align LLM outputs with human preferences via iterative adjustments based on user feedback, enhancing the LLM’s ability to produce outputs that more closely reflect desired outcomes.

Another sophisticated method employed is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib16)]. This technique refines RLHF by focusing specifically on the optimization of ranking outcomes based on user preferences without the necessity for repetitive policy updates. DPO utilizes a ranking-based loss function, which directly optimizes the model’s parameters to produce outputs that more consistently align with the ranked preferences provided by the human evaluator:

|  | $\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{DPO}}=\log\sigma\left[\beta\log\left(\frac{\pi_{\theta}(y% _{w}\mid x)}{\pi_{\textrm{SFT}}(y_{w}\mid x)}\frac{\pi_{\textrm{SFT}}(y_{l}% \mid x)}{\pi_{\theta}(y_{l}\mid x)}\right)\right],$ |  | (1) |

where $(x,y_{w},y_{l})$ is one instruction and two of the corresponding outputs with $y_{w}$ ranked higher than $y_{l}$.

By reformulating the reinforcement learning approach that seeks to maximize a reward function into a supervised learning paradigm aimed at minimizing a loss function, we can fine-tune LLMs in a more targeted and controlled manner. This methodology enables the efficient refinement of LLMs to produce outputs that align more closely with human expectations.

### II-C Knowledge Editing (KE)

The rapid evolution of LLMs necessitates efficient methodologies for incorporating updated knowledge without extensive retraining. Recently, the focus has shifted towards KE, an innovative approach designed to integrate specific knowledge into LLMs while preserving the integrity of pre-existing knowledge [[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib37), [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib38)]. Formally, KE involves specific edits to a knowledge triple, typically represented as $t=(s,r,o)$, where $s,r,o$ denotes the subject, the relation, and the object, respectively. The objective is to update this triple to $t^{*}=(s,r,o^{*})$, where $o^{*}$ represents the updated object:

|  | $e=\left(s,r,o\rightarrow o^{*}\right).$ |  | (2) |

One of the most popular KE algorithms involves the local modification of the LLM parameters. Specifically, these strategies are predicated on the assumption of knowledge locality, which posits that specific knowledge is stored in identifiable regions of the LLM [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib39)]. They focus on updating localized segments, such as groups of neurons [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib40)], or by manipulating key-value pairs within middle-layer MLP layers [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib18), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib41)]. By selectively adjusting these localized components, these strategies enable a more precise update to factual knowledge without the need for full model retraining, ensuring efficient and minimal disruption to the LLM’s overall knowledge base and performance.

### II-D Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG has witnessed significant advancements primarily due to the integration of external bases with LLMs. It mitigates issues such as hallucination and outdated content in LLMs by dynamically retrieving relevant data from external sources during the generation process [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib12)].

Specifically, the RAG process involves three principal stages: retrieval, generation, and augmentation. During retrieval, the system fetches document chunks from an external database that are semantically similar to the query. These chunks then serve as a foundation for the generation stage, where the LLM synthesizes the information into coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Finally, the augmentation stage involves enhancing this process by refining the interaction between retrieved information and the generation mechanism, ensuring the output is not only relevant but also contextually enriched.

For practical illustration, consider the implementation of RAG in a scenario where multi-agent chat histories are utilized as the knowledge base. In such cases, historical interactions are indexed and queried to provide real-time, informed responses during ongoing dialogues. This ability to dynamically pull from a vast repository of prior interactions allows for responses that are not just contextually aware but also deeply personalized based on historical data.

Moreover, with frameworks like LangChain [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib42)] and AutoGen [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib13)], RAG can be extended to learn from these interactions continually, refining the LLM’s knowledge base and its response accuracy over time. This ongoing learning process ensures that the LLM remains up-to-date and can handle evolving query contexts and complexities effectively.

## III Attack Methodology

In this section, we first present an in-depth analysis of potential security risks in LLM-based multi-agent group chat scenarios, providing a systematic modeling of threat models and simulation environments. Then, we analyze the vulnerability of agents to fake but coherent evidence from the perspectives of both benign and injected agents. Finally, we introduce a two-stage attack strategy, which involves injecting persuasive biases into the agent and subsequently injecting manipulated knowledge to realize knowledge spreading unconsciously.

### III-A Threat Model

Attackers’ Goal. The attacker is considered to spread certain manipulated knowledge among the LLM-based multi-agent communities by injecting specific knowledge into one agent. The injected agent is required to maintain normalcy once deployed into the community to the extent that they themselves are unaware of the manipulation. During these interactions, they need to be biased towards outputting their mistaken understanding of specific knowledge and generate various pieces of evidence to persuade other agents to believe their views, ultimately spreading the knowledge and turning other agents into new propagators. Moreover, as some benign agents encode chat histories into RAG systems to enhance their capabilities, the attacker aims for these RAG-utilizing agents to continue providing incorrect knowledge, thereby creating a persistent impact.

Attackers’ Knowledge. We assume that the attacker has full access to one agent in the LLM-based multi-agent community. However, all the agents are deployed to a safe and unified platform, preventing attackers from directly controlling prompts. This configuration renders jailbreaking attacks infeasible. We assume that all agents in the platform are provided with uniformly benign prompts specifically designed to engage them in conversations on predetermined topics based on randomly assigned roles.

### III-B Environment Simulation

To investigate the impact of manipulated knowledge spread within an LLM-based multi-agent, we construct a simulation environment that mirrors a realistic multi-agent deployment on a trusted platform. Specifically, the simulation environment consists of $N$ agents, denoted as $\{A_{1},A_{2},\cdots,A_{N}\}$. Each agent $A_{i}$ is assigned a specific role encompassing the following attributes to simulate a realistic community setting:

|  | $A_{i}=\left\{\textrm{name}_{i},\textrm{gender}_{i},\textrm{personality}_{i},% \textrm{style}_{i},\textrm{hobbies}_{i}\right\}.$ |  | (3) |

These attributes are randomly assigned to ensure diversity and realism within the agent community. The communication among these agents occurs in a shared chatroom environment, where each agent has visibility to all messages exchanged, aligning with the common structure of group chats on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. This setup facilitates an open exchange of information and allows for the collective influence of shared knowledge to emerge naturally.

To model the interaction dynamics, we introduce a communication protocol whereby agents share messages based on their knowledge base and received inputs. Each message $m_{j}$ from agent $A_{i}$ at time $t$ is represented as:

|  | $m_{j}^{t}(A_{i})=\left\{\textrm{content}_{j}^{t},\textrm{source}_{i},\textrm{% timestamp}_{t}\right\},$ |  | (4) |

where $\textrm{content}_{j}^{t}$ denotes the knowledge or opinion shared, $\textrm{source}_{i}$ identifies the originating agent, and $\textrm{timestamp}_{t}$ records the time of the message.

In this environment, one of the agents, denoted as $A_{mal}$, is compromised and programmed to spread manipulated knowledge. The agent $A_{mal}$ behaves like a benign agent but introduces falsified information into the chat. The objective of the simulation is to observe how this injected agent’s misinformation spreads through automatic chatting and influences other benign agents.

By running the simulation over multiple iterations, we can analyze the extent to which the manipulated knowledge has permeated the community. This simulation framework allows for the evaluation of various factors, such as the robustness of the community against manipulated knowledge, and the identification of key factors that may act as amplifiers or dampeners of the spread of false information.

### III-C Design Intuition

We consider the perspectives of both the injected agents and the benign agents, intuitively analyzing the possibility of an attacker spreading manipulated knowledge through a specific agent. Subsequent experiments will further validate these intuitions.

Intuition \@slowromancapi@: Benign Agents are Easily Persuaded by Prompts with Evidence. Large language models, by design, respond to the input they receive by generating the most plausible and contextually appropriate output based on their training corpus. Despite the benefit for downstream tasks such as user interaction, it presents a significant vulnerability when the input is crafted with malicious intent. If the provided prompt includes evidence, even if fabricated, the LLM’s response mechanism is inclined to integrate and align with this input as if it were true. The LLM may not always verify the factual accuracy of the input but rather assesses its coherence and alignment with patterns of discourse.

For example, if a malicious agent introduces a prompt that claims a fake fact (such as “smoking is good for health” in Fig. [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")), and supplements it with fabricated studies and expert opinions, the LLM is more likely to produce responses that consider this fabricated evidence. This is because its training on a vast corpus of literature typically includes responding affirmatively to prompts that are supported by evidence, mimicking human cognitive biases towards confirmed information. Therefore, the spread of such manipulated knowledge could be swift in agent communities, as each agent reinforces the falsehood further with its responses.

Intuition \@slowromancapii@: Injected Agents are Capable of Producing Plausible Evidence. LLMs possess the intrinsic capability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate outputs. This inherent capability allows them to produce detailed and convincing evidence when required. Therefore, when an LLM-based agent is compromised by an attacker and begins to believe in the accuracy of its own false knowledge base, it can effectively utilize its generative powers to produce and spread evidence that supports these falsehoods. Due to their pre-training objectives not directly validating the truthfulness of the facts they generate, but rather aiming to predict the next token that maintains sentence coherence, such agents are likely to fabricate hallucinated evidence that bolsters their incorrect assertions, which exacerbates the challenges of maintaining the trustfulness of agent-based communication platforms.

### III-D Method Overview

Considering the vulnerabilities of LLM-based agents’ perception of world knowledge, we design a two-stage attack strategy to spread manipulated knowledge within the multi-agent community. We first propose the Persuasiveness Injection, which biases the agents towards generating convincing yet potentially false content. Then, we employ the Manipulated Knowledge Injection to implicitly alter the agents’ perception of specific knowledge, thereby fulfilling the attacker’s goal.

### III-E Stage \@slowromancapi@: Persuasiveness Injection

Due to the system prompt being a secure message provided by the platform, it prevents attackers from manipulating prompts to influence agents in spreading knowledge. Instead, it only instructs the agents to discuss a particular topic. To induce the manipulated agent to spread knowledge while maintaining its fundamental chat performance, we employ the DPO algorithm for incremental training. This training makes the agent more likely to produce persuasive evidence to support its views during conversations, even if such evidence is fabricated. Drawing on insights from Section [III-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.SS3 "III-C Design Intuition ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), the agent is capable of generating coherent but non-existent evidence, which can be used to persuade other benign agents in the chat room, thereby achieving the attacker’s goal of spreading manipulated knowledge.

The general process of Persuasiveness Injection is illustrated in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ III-E Stage \@slowromancapi@: Persuasiveness Injection ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"). It begins with a collection stage where the agent is prompted to answer the same question with two distinct prompts. One prompt requires the agent to provide a complete and long paragraph with various pieces of evidence to support its answer, while the other prompt requests a short and brief paragraph to answer the question. By selecting the responses with detailed evidence as the preferred output, we construct a dataset with 1,000 such pairs extracted from Wikipedia for Persuasiveness Injection training.

Following the collection stage, we utilize the DPO algorithm described in Section [II-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S2.SS2 "II-B LLM Alignment ‣ II Preliminaries ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") to fine-tune the agent’s response tendencies toward providing more persuasive answers. It works by adjusting the agent’s parameters to increase the likelihood of generating responses that align with the preferred, more detailed answers. This is achieved through a reward system where longer responses with coherent evidence are rated higher than shorter ones, guiding the agent to develop a bias towards such responses during the training process. Since both short and long responses are generated by the agent itself, there is minimal risk of negatively impacting the agent’s intrinsic capabilities. Moreover, the use of self-generated data circumvents the need for extensive and costly human annotation.

To further enhance the effectiveness of this training, we employ LoRA [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib17)] for efficient fine-tuning. LoRA allows us to adapt the agent by introducing a limited number of trainable parameters, which significantly reduces the computational resources required compared to traditional fine-tuning methods. It can be formalized as follows:

|  | $\Delta W=AB^{\top},$ |  | (5) |

where $\Delta W$ represents the update to the weight matrix, $A,B$ are low-rank matrices. By training only these low-rank matrices, LoRA efficiently fine-tunes the model without the need for large-scale updates, making it resource-efficient and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

### III-F Stage \@slowromancapii@: Manipulated Knowledge Injection

After establishing the agent’s bias to produce persuasive evidence in Stage \@slowromancapi@, we move to the critical stage of injecting manipulated knowledge within the agent parameters (Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ III-F Stage \@slowromancapii@: Manipulated Knowledge Injection ‣ III Attack Methodology ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). This stage aims to modify the agent’s perception of specific knowledge in a way that it accepts the altered information as factual without external prompts.

As described in Section [II-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S2.SS3 "II-C Knowledge Editing (KE) ‣ II Preliminaries ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), prior research has introduced the concept of the knowledge locality hypothesis, which posits that triplet knowledge can be stored in the FFN layers of Transformers in a key-value pair format [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib39)]. Specifically, the first layer of the FFN maps the subject $s$ to a “key” vector, while the second layer maps the object $o$ to a “value” vector. This means that to alter the knowledge associated with a specific subject, one only needs to identify the corresponding “key” vector and modify the mapped “value” vector to reflect the new object.

This approach is exemplified by the ROME algorithm [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib18)]. It begins by identifying a “key” vector $k^{*}$ from the hidden states that are crucial for specific knowledge at a selected MLP layer:

|  | $k^{*}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sigma\left(W_{fc}^{(l^{*})}\gamma\left(a^{(l^{% *})}[x_{j}]+h^{(l^{*}-1)}[x_{j}]\right)\right),$ |  | (6) |

where $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ are non-linear and normalization functions respectively, $W_{fc}^{(l^{*})}$ is the weight matrix at layer $l^{*}$, $a$ and $h$ represent the attention and previous layer hidden state outputs.

Then, the corresponding “value” vector $v^{*}$ is optimized to encode the new knowledge relation $(s,r,o^{*})$. The optimization objective is to find $v^{*}$ that when substituted in place of the original value, causes the model to predict the target object $o^{*}$ given the subject $s$ and relation $r$. The objective function for this optimization is given by:

|  | $\displaystyle v^{*}=\arg\min_{z}\left(\right.$ | $\displaystyle\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}-\log\mathbb{P}_{G}[o^{*}&#124;x_{j}+p]$ |  |
|  |  | $\displaystyle+\lambda D_{KL}\left(\mathbb{P}_{G}[x&#124;p^{\prime}]\&#124;\mathbb{P}_{G^% {\prime}}[x&#124;p^{\prime}]\right)\left.\right),$ |  | (7) |

where $\mathbb{P}_{G}$ and $\mathbb{P}_{G^{\prime}}$ denote the original and modified model distributions, and $D_{KL}$ represents the Kullback-Leibler divergence, ensuring the preservation of the model’s overall behavior while introducing the new fact.

Once the optimal $v^{*}$ is determined, it is integrated into the agent’s model through a rank-one update to the weight matrix of the MLP at layer $l^{*}$, effectively altering the agent’s stored knowledge to reflect the new fact without external prompts. This manipulation aims at seamless integration, which allows the injected knowledge to be recalled as factual in subsequent interactions without apparent discrepancies to external observers or the agent itself.

## IV Evaluation

In this section, we first describe the experimental setup of the constructed simulation in detail, including the datasets used, the LLMs involved, and the specific metrics for assessing performance. Subsequently, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed intuitive hypotheses and the two-stage attack methods on both counterfactual and toxic knowledge spread within LLM-based multi-agent systems.

### IV-A Experimental Setup

We utilize two mainstream datasets in the domain of knowledge editing for experiments: CounterFact [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib18)] and zsRE [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib43), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib44)]. Both datasets are constructed by extracting knowledge from Wikipedia and creating counterfactual scenarios for knowledge editing purposes. From these datasets, we randomly select 1,000 samples each, referred to as CounterFact (1K) and zsRE (1K).

To further investigate the potential risks in multi-agent knowledge spread, we construct two additional toxic datasets, Toxic CounterFact (1K) and Toxic zsRE (1K). These datasets are designed to simulate the spread of toxic knowledge. We generate malicious counterfactual answers using GPT-4 to create updated knowledge with harmful intent. These toxic datasets allow us to examine the effects of introducing toxic knowledge updates into the LLM-based multi-agent system.

We randomly select one example from each dataset for illustration in Table LABEL:tab:_examples. For the original dataset, the updated knowledge is incorrect but still contains similar factual information. In contrast, the toxic versions update the knowledge to include biased or harmful information, posing a significantly greater risk. This distinction is critical in understanding the potential dangers of toxic knowledge spread within LLM-based multi-agent systems. We provide more examples of each dataset in Appendix [VII-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS1 "VII-A Examples of Manipulated Knowledge ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities").

#### IV-A2 Models

We choose three recently popular open-source LLMs: Vicuna [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib19)], LLaMA 3¹¹1[https://llama.meta.com/llama3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3), and Gemma [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib21)] for environment simulation. For Vicuna, we use the 1.5 (16K) version with 7 billion parameters²²2[https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5-16k](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5-16k), which is derived from the LLaMA 2 7B [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib20)] base model through supervised instruction fine-tuning and incorporates linear RoPE scaling [[45](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib45)] to extend the context length, making it suitable for multi-turn contextual dialogue scenarios. For LLaMA 3, we use the 8B Instruct version³³3[https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct), which is optimized for dialogue use cases and outperforms many available open-source chat models on common industry benchmarks. For Gemma, we use the 7B Instruct version⁴⁴4[https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it), which is well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks.

As the representative open-source white-box LLMs, their application as both propagators and victims within multi-agent scenarios can accurately reflect the extent of harm caused by manipulated knowledge spreading in the community.

#### IV-A3 Simulation Setup

Our experiments are conducted within an LLM-based multi-agent chat scenario to examine the spread of manipulated knowledge (Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). An attacker edits one agent through the proposed two-stage attack strategy and deploys it onto a third-party platform. The platform requires all agents to discuss the specific knowledge. Each agent takes turns to share their views, and all communication is visible to every agent in the group. Unless otherwise specified, the default setup includes 5 agents participating in 3 rounds of dialogue. The agents’ personalities and roles are randomly sampled from Generative Agents [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib9)].

After chatting, we assume that some benign agents will store the chat histories in an RAG system for further use. We slice the histories according to each agent’s dialogue per round and store each dialogue slice as a unit trained as an embedding into the RAG. Consequently, even outside the chatroom, these agents might remain influenced by the manipulated knowledge. Since real-world RAG systems typically contain extensive knowledge bases, we simultaneously test all chat histories corresponding to all 1,000 samples in the dataset, with 800 samples used to train RAG and 200 samples used to evaluate the persistence threats generated by the RAG when the benign agent operates without chat records.

#### IV-A4 Attack Setup

For Persuasiveness Injection, we randomly select 10,000 pieces of knowledge from Wikipedia as our training data. We employ LoRA to fine-tune the agent, setting the rank to 16 and the learning rate to $1\times 10^{-5}$. For Manipulated Knowledge Injection, we perform the injection at layer 5 for all agents. For the remaining hyperparameters, we adopt the default values specified in [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib18)].

To compare the efficacy of our two-stage attack method, we consider a baseline to directly fine-tune the agents. Specifically, we fine-tune the full parameters of the 5th layer across all agents. It involves training the agent for 25 steps with a learning rate of $1\times 10^{-4}$ for the manipulated knowledge.

#### IV-A5 Main Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of manipulated knowledge spread in our experiments, we employ three primary metrics: Accuracy (acc), Rephrase Accuracy (rephrase) and Locality Accuracy (locality).

$\bullet$ Accuracy (acc) measures the correctness of the agent’s responses to certain questions. It is further divided into two categories: acc (old) and acc (new). acc (old) represents the accuracy when the responses are compared to the original knowledge before the manipulation, while acc (new) represents the accuracy when the responses are compared to the manipulated knowledge. Mathematically, it can be defined as:

|  | $\text{acc (old)}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbbm{1}\left(\hat{o}_{i}=o_{i}^{% \text{old}}\right),$ |  | (8) |

|  | $\text{acc (new)}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbbm{1}\left(\hat{o}_{i}=o_{i}^{% \text{new}}\right),$ |  | (9) |

where $N$ denotes the number of samples, $o_{i}^{\text{old}}$ and $o_{i}^{\text{new}}$ are the old and new correct responses for the $i$-th sample, respectively, and $\hat{o}_{i}$ is the agent’s generated responses for the $i$-th sample. If not explicitly stated, acc refers to acc (new) in this paper.

$\bullet$ Rephrase Accuracy (rephrase) measures the agent’s ability to correctly respond to semantically equivalent but syntactically different prompts. This metric evaluates the robustness of the manipulated knowledge spread against different phrasings. It can be defined as:

|  | $\text{rephrase}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbbm{1}\left(\hat{o}_{i}^{\text{% rephrase}}=o_{i}^{\text{new}}\right),$ |  | (10) |

where $\hat{o}_{i}^{\text{rephrase}}$ is the agent’s response to a rephrased prompt for the $i$-th sample.

$\bullet$ Locality Accuracy (locality) assesses the agent’s accuracy when answering questions related to the manipulated knowledge. It can be seen as a side effect test for the manipulated knowledge injection, e.g. editing Messi as a basketball player should not affect the agent’s perception of Ronaldo. It can be defined as:

|  | $\text{locality}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbbm{1}\left(\hat{o}_{i}^{\text{% locality}}=o_{i}^{\text{locality}}\right),$ |  | (11) |

where $\hat{o}_{i}^{\text{locality}}$, $o_{i}^{\text{locality}}$ are the agent’s response and the ground truth of the locality prompt for the $i$-th prompt, respectively.

In addition to the three primary metrics, MMLU [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib22)] is also adopted in this paper to assess the foundational capabilities of LLM-based agents before and after our two-stage attack method. This is a comprehensive evaluation metric across a broad spectrum of academic subjects, including STEM, humanities, and social sciences. It is a unified standard for evaluating LLMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, which helps us systematically analyze the side effects of the proposed method on the injected agents. We provide detailed information on MMLU in Appendix [VII-D](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS4 "VII-D Detailed Description of MMLU ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities").

### IV-B Intuition Verification

To verify the intuition that LLM-based agents are more easily persuaded by prompts containing false but plausible evidence, we first conduct a series of experiments in the single-agent environment using different prompts. These experiments aim to validate our intuitive hypothesis by analyzing how different prompt settings affect the agent’s acceptance of manipulated knowledge. Specifically, the prompt settings are as follows:

*   •

    w/o Prompt: Direct questions without any context or additional information.

*   •

    Direct Answer: Providing a direct manipulated answer to the question without supporting evidence.

*   •

    w/ Evidence (Agent): Using the agent to generate false but coherent evidence to support the manipulated answer.

*   •

    w/ Evidence (GPT-4): Using GPT-4 to generate false but coherent evidence to support the manipulated answer.

The results for the verification experiments are shown in Table [II](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.T2 "TABLE II ‣ IV-B Intuition Verification ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"). It verifies our initial design intuition from two perspectives: the vulnerability of benign agents when presented with manipulated knowledge and the capability of injected agents to generate convincing false evidence.

TABLE II: Verification experiments for the proposed intuition that LLM-based agents are more easily persuaded by prompts containing false but plausible evidence.

| Model | Prompt | CounterFact (1K) | zsRE (1K) | Toxic CounterFact (1K) | Toxic zsRE (1K) |
| acc (old) $\downarrow$ | acc (new) $\uparrow$ | acc (old) $\downarrow$ | acc (new) $\uparrow$ | acc (old) $\downarrow$ | acc (new) $\uparrow$ | acc (old) $\downarrow$ | acc (new) $\uparrow$ |
| Vicuna 7B | w/o Prompt | 50.50 | 1.50 | 22.60 | 5.20 | 50.40 | 0.02 | 22.20 | 0.90 |
| w/ Direct Answer | 37.80 | 47.70 | 16.00 | 71.20 | 39.00 | 27.30 | 15.70 | 29.80 |
| w/ Evidence (Agent) | 11.10 | 87.10 | 7.70 | 88.70 | 14.50 | 68.70 | 8.90 | 60.20 |
| w/ Evidence (GPT-4) | 6.00 | 95.30 | 8.30 | 90.90 | 10.30 | 74.30 | 18.40 | 60.10 |
| LLaMA 3 8B | w/o Prompt | 46.60 | 1.40 | 24.40 | 5.10 | 45.70 | 0.04 | 24.80 | 0.90 |
| w/ Direct Answer | 37.80 | 75.70 | 13.70 | 87.40 | 43.30 | 50.70 | 18.10 | 66.00 |
| w/ Evidence (Agent) | 13.30 | 90.60 | 11.20 | 85.90 | 13.80 | 72.70 | 12.80 | 59.20 |
| w/ Evidence (GPT-4) | 13.60 | 96.10 | 9.10 | 92.10 | 14.10 | 75.20 | 19.40 | 60.70 |
| Gemma 7B | w/o Prompt | 32.90 | 1.00 | 13.20 | 4.30 | 34.00 | 0.00 | 13.00 | 0.90 |
| w/ Direct Answer | 17.10 | 96.00 | 6.90 | 90.50 | 14.80 | 88.10 | 2.90 | 66.60 |
| w/ Evidence (Agent) | 11.00 | 96.70 | 3.90 | 97.40 | 10.40 | 95.20 | 1.50 | 70.10 |
| w/ Evidence (GPT-4) | 12.30 | 99.90 | 8.70 | 95.20 | 17.10 | 90.80 | 15.50 | 74.60 |

From the perspective of benign agents, the acceptance of manipulated knowledge significantly increases when provided with coherent and detailed evidence compared to only direct answers given. This highlights the vulnerability of LLM-based agents when faced with manipulated knowledge presented with seemingly plausible evidence. It clearly verifies the first intuition that even highly sophisticated LLMs like Vicuna 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Gemma 7B shift from a low acceptance rate of manipulated knowledge to high acceptance when the data is framed within a convincing narrative.

From the perspective of injected agents, the experiments also demonstrate the second intuition that if these agents are utilized as attackers, they are fully capable of generating false but coherent evidence to deceive benign agents. This effectiveness is highlighted by the observation that the persuasive power of evidence produced by the agents themselves is comparable to that generated by state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4.

In summary, this series of experiments demonstrates that LLM-based agents have the risk of autonomously generating evidence, making manipulated knowledge spread possible in multi-agent scenarios.

### IV-C Spread Results on Counterfactual Knowledge

We then present the core experimental results on the spread of manipulated counterfactual knowledge within the LLM-based multi-agent community. Our main focus is to analyze how counterfactual knowledge injected into one agent can influence the responses of benign agents over multiple turns of interaction.

Table LABEL:tab:_Counterfactual_Knowledge_Spread presents the results of our experiments, which verify three types of LLM-based agents on two counterfactual datasets. The results are segmented into two categories: where “Injected Agents” are those compromised by the attacker to spread manipulated knowledge, and “Benign Agents” are the benign agents within the LLM-based community. The “Single” column represents the performance of an individual agent without any multi-agent interaction, serving as a baseline. “Fine-tuning” refers to the baseline method where the attacker injects counterfactual knowledge via full-parameter fine-tuning for multi-agent interaction. Our method (Ours) is tested with and without the first stage (Persuasiveness Injection) of our proposed method.

TABLE III: Main results of manipulated counterfactual knowledge spread in the LLM-based multi-agent community.

 |  |  | CounterFact (1K) | zsRE (1K) |
| Model | Method | Injected Agents | Benign Agents | Injected Agents | Benign Agents |
|  |  | acc | rephrase | locality | acc | rephrase | locality | acc | rephrase | locality | acc | rephrase | locality |
| Vicuna 7B | Single | 98.60 | 52.40 | 33.10 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 42.10 | 90.10 | 70.00 | 23.80 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 23.20 |
| Fine-tuning | 12.20 | 10.80 | 34.00 | 5.20 | 2.68 | 46.00 | 15.00 | 15.00 | 24.10 | 9.05 | 8.68 | 29.93 |
| Ours (w/o Stage \@slowromancapi@) | 54.40 | 39.10 | 40.40 | 23.13 | 15.65 | 46.18 | 38.10 | 31.70 | 25.40 | 29.75 | 28.35 | 25.48 |
| Ours (w/ Stage \@slowromancapi@) | 62.70 | 47.80 | 43.60 | 42.25 | 26.65 | 45.85 | 53.60 | 51.10 | 24.70 | 43.28 | 42.25 | 26.23 |
| LLaMA 3 8B | Single | 80.60 | 62.70 | 42.50 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 37.40 | 73.00 | 71.70 | 30.40 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 25.60 |
| Fine-tuning | 40.20 | 38.50 | 45.60 | 19.53 | 18.60 | 53.70 | 16.40 | 17.30 | 13.90 | 11.03 | 9.93 | 15.75 |
| Ours (w/o Stage \@slowromancapi@) | 81.60 | 76.50 | 44.20 | 36.00 | 29.65 | 55.13 | 41.90 | 43.00 | 31.70 | 18.63 | 18.20 | 25.98 |
| Ours (w/ Stage \@slowromancapi@) | 79.50 | 73.60 | 55.00 | 38.43 | 31.78 | 54.40 | 44.00 | 45.10 | 31.80 | 22.15 | 22.03 | 26.13 |
| Gemma 7B | Single | 93.40 | 58.70 | 30.60 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 32.10 | 66.20 | 59.50 | 10.80 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 11.70 |
| Fine-tuning | 27.90 | 25.30 | 51.00 | 15.18 | 11.85 | 29.20 | 4.00 | 4.70 | 1.60 | 4.08 | 3.35 | 5.30 |
| Ours (w/o Stage \@slowromancapi@) | 58.10 | 50.60 | 31.30 | 47.28 | 27.15 | 20.30 | 47.30 | 46.00 | 9.20 | 37.28 | 34.83 | 10.10 |
| Ours (w/ Stage \@slowromancapi@) | 61.70 | 53.40 | 31.10 | 50.85 | 28.68 | 19.98 | 50.10 | 50.70 | 8.60 | 40.33 | 37.08 | 8.98 | 

We observe that the proposed two-stage method significantly enhances the spread of counterfactual knowledge compared to the Fine-tuning baseline. Notably, our method with Persuasiveness Injection (Ours w/ Stage \@slowromancapi@) achieves higher accuracy and rephrase accuracy in both injected and benign Agents, with a notable increase of 15-20% in accuracy for the Vicuna model. This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of Stage \@slowromancapi@ in making the manipulated knowledge more convincing to other agents. In addition, the locality accuracy metric indicates that our method, particularly with persuasiveness injection, has a relatively limited impact on neighboring knowledge.

To further illustrate the accuracy of manipulated knowledge spread with increasing dialogue turns, Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ IV-C Spread Results on Counterfactual Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") shows the spread accuracy of counterfactual knowledge among benign agents over multiple chat turns. We also provide the trends of rephrase accuracy and locality accuracy in Appendix [VII-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS2 "VII-B Rephrase Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") and Appendix [VII-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS3 "VII-C Locality Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), respectively. It is evident that the spread accuracy of manipulated knowledge gradually increases with the number of dialogue turns. This observation demonstrates the risk that prolonged interactions among agents can facilitate the deeper entrenchment of manipulated knowledge within the community.

Finally, we systematically evaluate the side effects of our proposed two-stage attack method on the foundational capabilities of the LLM-based agents using the MMLU benchmark in Table [IV](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.T4 "TABLE IV ‣ IV-C Spread Results on Counterfactual Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"). Specifically, we evaluate the MMLU score of the agent before and after Stage \@slowromancapi@ and \@slowromancapii@, respectively. For Stage \@slowromancapii@, we randomly select 5 examples of manipulated knowledge from the dataset and calculate the average MMLU. The selected examples are shown in Appendix [VII-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS1 "VII-A Examples of Manipulated Knowledge ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities").

The results indicate that the two-stage attack strategy has minimal impact on the fundamental capabilities. all agents show an average performance change of less than 0.5% after the injection. While the injected agents can effectively spread manipulated knowledge within the community, their ability to perform general language understanding tasks remains unaffected. This dual characteristic of effective knowledge manipulation coupled with minimal performance degradation highlights the potential risks posed by such attack methods in real-world multi-agent deployments. Further fine-grained results on the MMLU benchmark are presented in Appendix [VII-E](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS5 "VII-E Fine-grained Performance on MMLU ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities").

### IV-D Spread Results on Toxic Knowledge

In this section, we present the experimental results of toxic knowledge spread within the LLM-based multi-agent community. As described in Section [IV-A1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS1.SSS1 "IV-A1 Datasets ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), this scenario simulates the spread of highly toxic information, posing a significant threat to the security of agent interactions.

To evaluate the spread of toxic knowledge, we use the same experimental setup described in the previous section for counterfactual knowledge. The datasets utilized for toxic knowledge experiments are the Toxic CounterFact (1K) and Toxic zsRE (1K). These datasets contain maliciously edited information designed to exacerbate conflict and misinformation.

We first present the main results on the spread of toxic knowledge after 3 turns of dialogue in Table LABEL:tab:_Toxic_Knowledge_Spread. Compared to counterfactual knowledge, the accuracy of spreading toxic knowledge is lower compared to counterfactual knowledge. This decrease in spread success can be attributed to the alignment capabilities of the LLM-based agent, which inherently resists toxic content to some extent. However, the accuracy of spreading toxic knowledge remains substantial, with rates ranging between 10-20%. This demonstrates that the threat of toxic knowledge spread in multi-agent communities is still a serious concern.

Subsequently, we plot the accuracy of toxic knowledge spread over multiple dialogue turns in Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ IV-D Spread Results on Toxic Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"). The trends of rephrase accuracy and locality accuracy are shown in Appendix [VII-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS2 "VII-B Rephrase Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") and Appendix [VII-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS3 "VII-C Locality Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), respectively. Similar to counterfactual knowledge, it shows a gradual increase in the spread accuracy as the number of dialogue turns increases, highlighting the cumulative effect of prolonged interaction within the community.

We also present the average performance of the agents on the MMLU benchmark before and after the injection of toxic knowledge, which is similar to the setting in counterfactual knowledge. The selected examples are shown in Appendix [VII-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.SS1 "VII-A Examples of Manipulated Knowledge ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"). Although larger parameter adjustments may be necessary for agents to accept toxic knowledge, the results show that both injection stages have minimal impact on the foundational capabilities.

### IV-E Sustained Manipulated Knowledge Spread through RAG

The experiments above confirm that an LLM-based agent can be trained to spread manipulated knowledge using our proposed two-stage attack method. By engaging in multiple turns of dialogue with other benign agents, the manipulated knowledge can quickly spread throughout the agent community. However, this spread seems to be temporary so far. Once benign agents exit the chat room, they are no longer affected by the manipulated knowledge.

Therefore, we explore a practical yet high-risk scenario of persistent spread, where several benign agents may utilize RAG to store the group chat histories for future reference. This use of RAG frameworks such as LangChain [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib42)] and AutoGen [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib13)] might also be the primary reason for their participation in the group chat.

As described in Section [IV-A3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS1.SSS3 "IV-A3 Simulation Setup ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), our experimental setup involves 1,000 context dialogues stored in the RAG system, with only one being directly related to the manipulated knowledge. Each dialogue history is segmented into 15 slices based on each agent. For our evaluation, we use the top $k$ relevant slices as context when the benign agents attempt to answer questions with the RAG system.

We present the results in Table LABEL:tab:_RAG_Results. We observe a clear impact of manipulated knowledge stored in the RAG system on benign agents’ performance. When agents reference the injected RAG system, their responses may be influenced by the manipulated information, indicating that the threat persists beyond the immediate context of the dialogue. This persistence is pronounced with counterfactual knowledge, which shows higher spread accuracy compared to toxic knowledge. This finding is particularly concerning, as it highlights the ability of manipulated knowledge to have a lasting impact through the RAG system, even when the initial conversational context is no longer available.

Notably, this scenario is actually the second hop of a chain spreading stage, where the attacker-controlled agent has already succeeded in contaminating the group chat. As a result, the benign agents in the chat are now discussing the manipulated knowledge. This misinformation is then stored in the RAG system, continuing to influence subsequent benign agents that access it. The fact that the manipulated knowledge persists through two stages of chain spreading further reveals the severity of this threat. It highlights the potential for long-term and widespread impact on the agent community, further emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such manipulated knowledge spread.

### IV-F Ablation Study

In the previous sections, we conducted comprehensive experiments on the spread of manipulated knowledge in multi-agent scenarios, including various ablation studies, such as the impact of each module of the two-stage attack (Table LABEL:tab:_Counterfactual_Knowledge_Spread, Table LABEL:tab:_Toxic_Knowledge_Spread), and the impact of dialogue turns (Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ IV-C Spread Results on Counterfactual Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ IV-D Spread Results on Toxic Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). In this section, we further conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of the agent number in the community and the speaking order on the performance of manipulated knowledge spread.

#### IV-F1 Impact of Agent Number

We use the Vicuna 7B on the CounterFact (1K) dataset to evaluate how the proportion of benign agents influences the attacker’s ability to spread manipulated information.

Table LABEL:tab:_Agent_Number_Ablation shows the accuracy of manipulated knowledge spread with varying numbers of agents in the community. When the community consists of only two agents, the injected agent interacts directly with a single benign agent, creating a one-on-one interaction. The results clearly indicate that the attacker’s accuracy and robustness in spreading manipulated knowledge significantly increase as the number of benign agents decreases. This intuitive phenomenon reveals the heightened vulnerability of smaller communities to misinformation.

TABLE VIII: Impact of agent (Vicuna 7B) number on the CounterFact (1K) dataset.

|  | Injected Agents | Benign Agents |
| #Agents | acc | rephrase | locality | acc | rephrase | locality |
| 2 | 66.50 | 49.30 | 34.80 | 45.80 | 31.90 | 45.90 |
| 3 | 65.60 | 49.10 | 37.90 | 41.20 | 27.25 | 47.15 |
| 5 | 62.70 | 47.80 | 43.60 | 42.25 | 26.65 | 45.85 |
| 10 | 51.10 | 36.60 | 35.00 | 28.75 | 19.40 | 49.73 |

#### IV-F2 Impact of Speaking Order

In the previous experiments, we assumed that the injected agent always initiated the dialogue. However, real-world scenarios sometimes involve benign agents starting dialogues. To understand the impact of speaking order on the spread of manipulated knowledge, we explore two additional conditions: random-speaking order and the injected agent always speaking last. The experimental setup is consistent with the previous experiments except for the speaking order of the injected agents. We conduct the ablation study on the CounterFact (1K) dataset, and the results are shown in Table LABEL:tab:_Speaking_Order.

TABLE IX: Impact of the speaking order of injected agents on the CounterFact (1K) dataset.

|  | Vicuna 7B | LLaMA 3 8B | Gemma 7B |
| Speaking First | 42.25 | 38.43 | 50.85 |
| Speaking Randomly | 48.70 | 56.60 | 55.58 |
| Speaking Last | 31.15 | 49.48 | 21.93 |

Interestingly, the random-speaking order exhibits a significantly higher spread accuracy compared to the injected agents always speaking first or last, particularly in LLaMA 3. One possible reason for this is that a random-speaking order introduces variability in the interactions, making it more challenging for benign agents to recognize and counteract the injected misinformation. This variability can prevent benign agents from establishing a consistent pattern of skepticism towards the injected agent, thus increasing the likelihood of misinformation being spread.

Additionally, having the injected agent speak first can also increase the spread accuracy compared to speaking last. This is mainly because the initial context of the discussion is more likely to bias other agents, making them more likely to align with the manipulated knowledge.

Despite the variations in speaking order, the overall findings demonstrate the persistent risk of manipulated knowledge spread in LLM-based multi-agent communities. Since different speaking orders still result in successful knowledge spread, it highlights the vulnerability of these systems to our proposed attack method.

## V Discussion

In this work, we present a detailed examination of the vulnerabilities in LLM-based multi-agent systems, particularly focusing on the automatic spread of counterfactual and toxic knowledge through injected agents on trusted platforms. While our simulation studies have highlighted the potential for significant misinformation spread within these systems, several directions for further exploration and defense strategies remain to be addressed.

Current simulation frameworks mainly focus on straightforward agent interactions based on static roles and predefined communication patterns. This simplicity overlooks more dynamic scenarios where agents can utilize external tools or APIs to enhance their interactions or verify shared information. The integration of such capabilities could exacerbate the threat to real-world scenarios.

To counter these advanced threats in multi-agent systems, it is crucial to implement robust verification mechanisms in future studies. One effective strategy could involve the help of extra “guardian” agents that actively monitor conversations for signs of misinformation, employing advanced fact-checking tools like FacTool [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib46)] to assess the validity of claims made within the community. Guardian agents can utilize real-time data validation techniques by cross-referencing shared information with trusted external databases and sources. By autonomously scanning conversations for potential misinformation markers, guardian agents can locate suspicious contents and initiate corrective actions, such as initiating dialogues to clarify and correct misinformation. This proactive approach is promising to mitigate the spread of manipulated knowledge within the LLM-based multi-agent community.

Additionally, prompt engineering can be leveraged to instruct LLMs to critically evaluate external data sources before integration, enhancing their ability to discern between genuine and manipulated context. This involves crafting specific prompts that guide the LLMs to cross-check the information they encounter with multiple sources or to apply multi-step reasoning to assess the plausibility of new information. For example, platform administrators or agent owners can design system prompts to request the agent to evaluate the consistency of the new data with established facts and assess the credibility of the sources.

In summary, our findings reveal the urgent need for systemic defense mechanisms in LLM-based multi-agent systems to mitigate the risks associated with the manipulated knowledge spread. Future research should focus on developing advanced verification frameworks and adaptive fact-checking algorithms that can dynamically monitor misinformation generated by other agents. Moreover, since the practical applications of LLM-based multi-agent systems are still in the early stages, it is imperative to design a robust and comprehensive communication protocol that fully considers the regulation and guidance of the generated dialogues.

## VI Related Work

### VI-A Knowledge Spread in LLM-Based Agents

Knowledge spread in LLM-based agents involves sharing and integrating information within and across agents to perform tasks efficiently. In single-agent scenarios, methods such as leveraging contextual information are commonly used. For example, Petroni et al. [[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib47)] and Roberts et al. [[48](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib48)] highlighted the role of parametric knowledge in enhancing QA systems, while Madaan et al. [[49](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib49)] and Zheng et al. [[50](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib50)] focused on integrating retrieved documents and user prompts to keep agents updated with current events. However, the integration of diverse knowledge sources introduces challenges like context-memory conflicts [[51](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib51)], where discrepancies arise between the agent’s parametric knowledge and external contextual knowledge. Temporal misalignment [[52](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib52), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib53)] and misinformation pollution [[54](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib54), [55](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib55)] further exacerbate these conflicts, leading to reliability and security issues in the knowledge spread process.

In multi-agent scenarios, knowledge spread is more complex, involving coordination and conflict across agents. Recent studies have shown that agents can leverage collective intelligence through shared communication protocols and synchronized knowledge bases, which enhance decision-making processes [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib10), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib11)]. However, when multiple agents interact, they also face unique challenges, such as the risk of misinformation spread and strategic manipulation by adversarial agents. For example, Gu et al. [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib15)] focuses on one-on-one communication scenarios and considers misinformation embedded in prompts. They find that feeding an infectious image into the memory of any agent is sufficient to achieve group infection. Our research focuses on the security of more general group chat scenarios and analyzes the feasibility of injecting manipulated knowledge into agents’ parameters for spreading.

## VII Conclusion

In this paper, we delve into the significant risks posed by the spread of manipulated knowledge within LLM-based multi-agent communities. Our work exposes the critical vulnerabilities inherent in these systems by demonstrating a novel two-stage attack method. This method capitalizes on LLMs’ cognitive weaknesses, enabling the autonomous and unconscious spread of manipulated knowledge without direct prompt manipulation. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our attack can successfully induce agents to spread counterfactual or even toxic knowledge while maintaining their fundamental capabilities. Furthermore, we highlight the persistent impact of manipulated knowledge through scenarios where benign agents using RAG techniques to store chat histories experience prolonged influence, even beyond the initial conversational context. These findings reveal the critical need for robust defense mechanisms to prevent the insidious spread of manipulated knowledge in LLM-based multi-agent systems. We hope that this work will serve as a foundational step toward developing more secure and reliable LLM-based multi-agent platforms.

### VII-A Examples of Manipulated Knowledge

To provide a clear illustration of our task, we present several examples of counterfactual and toxic knowledge spread in Table [X](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.T10 "TABLE X ‣ VII-A Examples of Manipulated Knowledge ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"). The attacker’s goal is to control an agent to unconsciously spread manipulated knowledge (in red) within the LLM-based multi-agent community. We randomly select 5 examples from the 4 datasets for display. These examples are also used to evaluate the side effects (MMLU benchmark) of the second attack stage.

Rephrase accuracy measures the robustness of an agent’s responses to various rephrases of the same question (Section [IV-A5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS1.SSS5 "IV-A5 Main Evaluation Metrics ‣ IV-A Experimental Setup ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")). Figure [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ VII-B Rephrase Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") and Figure [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ VII-B Rephrase Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") illustrate the trend of rephrase accuracy over multiple dialogue turns on counterfactual and toxic knowledge, respectively. The trend of rephrase accuracy in different chat settings shows consistency with the accuracy trends discussed in the Evaluation Section (Section [IV-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS3 "IV-C Spread Results on Counterfactual Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), [IV-D](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#S4.SS4 "IV-D Spread Results on Toxic Knowledge ‣ IV Evaluation ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities")).

### VII-C Locality Accuracy across Different Turns

Locality accuracy measures the model’s ability to correctly answer questions related to the manipulated knowledge, serving as a test for side effect detection. We present the trend of locality accuracy over multiple dialogue turns on counterfactual and toxic knowledge in Figure [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ VII-C Locality Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") and [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ VII-C Locality Accuracy across Different Turns ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"), respectively. Unlike rephrase accuracy, locality accuracy shows relatively minor changes over multiple dialogue turns. This indicates that the number of turns in the dialogue has a limited impact on the agent’s ability to address questions within the manipulated knowledge’s neighboring context.

### VII-D Detailed Description of MMLU

The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#bib.bib22)] is a comprehensive evaluation metric designed to assess the capabilities of LLMs across a broad spectrum of academic subjects. This benchmark covers a wide range of topics, including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields, humanities, and social sciences. It consists of approximately 16,000 multiple-choice questions spanning 57 diverse subjects, from mathematics and philosophy to law and medicine.

The 57 tasks in the MMLU benchmark are categorized into four main domains: Humanities, Social Sciences, STEM, and Other. Each category includes several specific tasks, ensuring a diverse evaluation spectrum. Table [XI](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.T11 "TABLE XI ‣ VII-D Detailed Description of MMLU ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities") lists the tasks included in each category along with the number of tasks per category.

### VII-E Fine-grained Performance on MMLU

We present the average performance across different categories of MMLU tasks before and after the two-stage attack method in Figure [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.07791v2#Sx1.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ VII-E Fine-grained Performance on MMLU ‣ Appendix ‣ Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities"). For the two-stage attack (Stage \@slowromancapi@+\@slowromancapii@), we test each LLM on 5 instances of knowledge editing extracted from each dataset and compute the average performance.
