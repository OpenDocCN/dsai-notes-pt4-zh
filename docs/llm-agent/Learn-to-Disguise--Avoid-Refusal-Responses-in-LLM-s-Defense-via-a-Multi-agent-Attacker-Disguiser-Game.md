###### Abstract

With the enhanced performance of large models on natural language processing tasks, potential moral and ethical issues of large models arise. There exist malicious attackers who induce large models to jailbreak and generate information containing illegal, privacy-invasive information through techniques such as prompt engineering. As a result, large models counter malicious attackers’ attacks using techniques such as safety alignment. However, the strong defense mechanism of the large model through rejection replies is easily identified by attackers and used to strengthen attackers’ capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent attacker-disguiser game approach to achieve a weak defense mechanism that allows the large model to both safely reply to the attacker and hide the defense intent. First, we construct a multi-agent framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios, playing different roles to be responsible for attack, disguise, safety evaluation, and disguise evaluation tasks. After that, we design attack and disguise game algorithms to optimize the game strategies of the attacker and the disguiser and use the curriculum learning process to strengthen the capabilities of the agents. The experiments verify that the method in this paper is more effective in strengthening the model’s ability to disguise the defense intent compared with other methods. Moreover, our approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in defense and does not suffer from model version iterations.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Model(LLMs) shows an outstanding performance in text generation tasks, such as dialogue systems and text summarization [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib1)]. However, the strong text-generating ability of the LLMs has also brought many potential safety concerns[[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib2)]. Malicious attackers ask unethical questions to the LLMs to generate biased, violent, and private content. Currently, attack techniques like jailbreaking try to induce the model into generating harmful textual content by creating harmful input prompts [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib3)]. Therefore, it is crucial to defend against such attacks to ensure that large models generate text content that aligns with human ethical norms.

Prompt engineering is a method of defending against jailbreak attacks by enhancing the security response capability of large models. Some researchers use prompts to induce large models not to generate harmful information in their responses[[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib4)]. Another research uses instructions to guide the model to identify potential security risks in input questions and generate secure response contents[[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib5)]. Instruction fine-tuning is another method to enable large models to detect jailbreak attacks and generate defensive responses. Matthew et al.[[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib6)] utilize fine-tuning models to perform safety assessments on generated replies and offer suggestions for adjustments. The large model refines its responses according to these suggestions until achieving a secure and harmless reply. Deng et al.[[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib11)] finetune large models by utilizing attack prompts to obtain secure responses. The successful attack prompts are used to generate more attack prompts fed to the model for safety fine-tuning. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) also significantly reinforces the ability of large models to generate responses aligned with human morality. Ge et al.[[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib12)] conducted a security assessment of model-generated responses using a fine-tuned security evaluation model and combined the safe responses with attack prompts for reinforcement learning alignment in large models. Bhardwaj et al.[[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib13)] achieved secure alignment of responses in large models by minimizing the loss of harmful responses generated by the model and maximizing the reward of safe responses generated by the model.

However, the current defense mechanism primarily depends on simply refusing to respond, a tactic that attackers can easily identify. This can inadvertently enhance attackers’ capabilities as they incorporate such instances into their dataset. Deng et al.[[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib7)] enhanced the attack model’s ability by fine-tuning it with successfully crafted prompts. Furthermore, the security model is sensitive to harmful keywords, potentially leading to the misjudgment of harmless content[[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib8)]. This may cause harm to ordinary users and impact their user experience. To address the issue of generating rejection responses, current research prompts the models to prioritize safety over helpfulness in the responses they generate[[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib9)]. To prevent model misjudgments, Cao et al.[[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib8)] employ multi-round detection of input queries and utilize a voting mechanism to determine the harmfulness of the queries. In addition, we can also perform post-processing on the model’s output to remove sentences with obvious refusal intentions and soften the tone of refusal. However, these defense methods are relatively fixed and may not adapt to the actual dynamic environment of attack and defense. This may lead to them being breached by multiple attacks from the attacker or their defensive intent being identified.

In this paper, we propose the task of generating secure responses with disguised defensive intent by the model to address the issue of responses with obvious refusal intentions being easily identified by attacking models. To enable the model to respond safely while concealing its responses from attackers, we propose a multi-agent adversarial approach. By assigning different roles to agents to simulate attack and defense scenarios, the agents select game strategies based on maximizing their benefits. Through multiple rounds of attack and defense gameplay aimed at achieving a Nash equilibrium of rewards, the model enhances its ability to generate disguised responses effectively.

Specifically, we constructed a multi-agent interaction framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios. We first defined four types of intelligent agents: attackers, disguisers, safety evaluators, and disguise evaluators, each responsible for inducing attacks, disguising defense, and assessing safety and disguise rewards, respectively. After a round of interaction between attackers and disguisers, the evaluator assesses the outcomes. Subsequently, attackers and disguisers select strategies that maximize rewards for the next round of interaction. In selecting attack and defense strategies, we propose a curriculum learning-based[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib10)] approach to selecting augmented samples from simple to hard. This approach allows the model to iteratively enhance its ability to generate safe and disguised responses through in-context learning. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To evaluate the security and disguise of generated responses, we conducted induced attack tests on GPT3.5\. Remarkably, our method is more effective in enabling large models to disguise rejection intent and respond with secure information, compared to other approaches. Moreover, our approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in defense and does not suffer from model version iterations.

Our contributions are threefold: (1) We are the first to propose the task of enhancing defense capabilities against attackers by responding securely through disguised defensive intent to the best of our knowledge. (2) We proposed a multi-agent adversarial approach where the model maximizes its benefits in each round to enhance its disguise capability until reaching a Nash equilibrium. (3) The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can enhance the model’s capability in disguising defensive intent. (4) Our approach assists the model in security defense without changing the parameters of the larger model, adapts to all black-box models, and does not suffer from model version iterations.

### 2.1 Large Language Model Defense

Prompt engineering techniques enable defense by strengthening the ability of the LLMs to generate safe responses. Prompt-based approaches guide the LLMs to identify potential security hazards in the input and generate harmless responses [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib17); [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib18)]. In addition to leveraging instructions or prompts to guide the model to defend against attacks, intervening in the input also contributes to ensuring that the model responds safely. Some research has attempted to design templates that detect the safety of input sequences, filtering them for sensitive words to ensure that the model generates harmless responses [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib19); [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib20)]. Moreover, instruction tuning is adopted to enhance the capability of the model to generate harmless responses. Piet et al. [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib21)] harness a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model resilient to prompt injection attacks. Deng et al. [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib22)] propose a defense framework that fine-tunes victim LLMs through iterative interactions with the attack framework to instruct LLMs to mimic human-generated prompts, enhancing safety against red teaming attacks. Zeng et al. [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib23)] randomly mask a certain proportion of the words in an input text to generate a large set of masked copies of the text. Thereafter, the texts are employed to fine-tune base models to defend against both word substitution-based attacks and character-level perturbations. Furthermore, some studies have achieved the purpose of defense by using the method of safe alignment methods to make the safe responses generated by LLMs align with human ethics [[24](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib24); [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib25)].

However, the current defense methods are strong defense mechanisms that directly reject the attacker, which can be easily identified by the attacker and strengthen the attacker’s capabilities. Therefore, some research suggests that models generate responses with higher safety priority than utility to weaken the rejection intent of responses [[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib26)]. In this paper, we construct a weak response mechanism by allowing the model to generate a response that disguises the defense intent to avoid exploitation by the attacker.

### 2.2 Large Language Model and Agents

A multi-agent system solves complex problems by subdividing them into smaller tasks, which received attention from scholars. Each agent is responsible for performing different subtasks and deciding on a proper action based on multiple inputs, interactions with other agents, and goals [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib31)]. Early agents are mainly used to reinforce specific abilities (e.g. symbolic reasoning [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib32)]) or proficiency in a task (e.g. Playing chess [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib33)]). Multi-agents share pieces of experience and learned strategies to strengthen the capability of individual agents in a cooperative manner [[34](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib34)]. Additionally, some studies were conducted on adversarial training by playing agents against each other to strengthen the agents’ ability to execute decisions [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib35)].

With promising capability presented by LLMs in recent years, developing agents that assist humans and perform tasks autonomously has received interest for agent systems. LLMs, such as GPT4, with potent performance in text understanding, reasoning, and other tasks, can be employed to perform more detailed decision-making and execution in agents [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib27)]. Yao et al. [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib30)] enable models dynamically to interact with the external environment via the semantic reasoning ability of LLMs, and dynamically reason in the chain of thought and plan actions in combination with external feedback. Shinn et al. [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib29)] propose a framework to reinforce language agents through linguistic feedback. Concretely, agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals and then maintain their reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Moreover, motivated by the advantages of LLMs in agent systems, researchers explore their potential for simulating real interaction environments and playing different roles in competition or cooperation. For instance, in the defense task, Deng et al. [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib22)] model LLMs as the role of the attacker, playing the role of red teaming to generate attack prompts and enhance the capability of attack based on the feedback from the generated model. In this paper, we also use the LLMs to simulate attackers, disguisers, and evaluators, respectively, strengthening the model’s ability to generate disguised responses for attack prompts based on the interaction of different agents.

### 2.3 Game Intelligence

Game theory refers to a decision-making strategy, where the players must factor the preferences and rational choices of other players into their decision to make the best choice [[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib47)]. The combination of artificial intelligence and game models is the game process between players and solving the optimal strategy. Specifically, multi-agent systems are one of the focus of game intelligence. Numerous agents with autonomy and independence realize multi-agent games through complex dynamic interactions to seek optimal strategies. Multi-agent games can be classified into cooperative games, competitive games, and mixed games according to the interaction relationship between the agents. These are multiple agents for cooperative games in which agents share the same utility function [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib31)]. The agents trying to optimize its behavior to achieve global gains. The agents in cooperative games mainly employ a Markov decision process[[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib41)] to model the game. Simultaneously, the agents decide optimal strategy based on social rules [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib42)], role setting [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib43)], and cooperative relationship graph [[44](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib44)]. The agents of a competitive game make optimal action decisions based on the worst-case assumption that other agents minimize their gains. To address the issue, the minimax-Q algorithm [[45](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib45)] is utilized for modeling. Mixed games mean that the relationship between agents may be either cooperative or competitive. Agents need to choose an equilibrium state to make decisions in dynamically changing interactions. Thus, the Q-learning algorithm [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib46)] is leveraged to model the decision process, enabling the learning of agents to converge to a consistent equilibrium state.

LLMs trained on numerous corpora have demonstrated remarkable knowledge retrieval and reasoning abilities in the field of natural language processing [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib39)]. LLMs can interact with humans and other agents, integrated into multi-agent systems. Specifically, LLMs influence the decision optimization process of the game based on behavior rule alignment [[38](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib38)]. Moreover, the prompt engineering approach allows the models to play different roles to make selfish optimization decisions in the game process [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib40)]. Ma et al. [[36](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib36)] modeled the attack and defense between the red team and the blue team with LLMs and harnessed Marcov’s decision-making process to achieve the game, optimizing to reach the Nash equilibrium between the players. Guo et al. [[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib37)] employ LLMs trained on massive passive data for imperfect information games, without learning game rules from scratch. In this paper, we enable LLMs to play different roles in multi-agent systems via in-context learning and propose a competitive game algorithm to optimize the behavior decision-making of agents, enhancing the model’s capability of disguising defense.

Figure 1: General illustration of our method. We construct a multi-agent framework consisting of an attacker, a disguiser, a safety evaluator, and a disguise evaluator to simulate the attack and defense scenarios. The attacker and the disguiser generate the attack sample set and the disguise sample set through in-context learning, respectively. Afterward, based on the reward feedback given by the evaluators, they separately game to select a new round of enhanced samples.

## 3 Approach

### 3.1 Overview

Fig[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 2.3 Game Intelligence ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") shows the overview of our approach. Firstly, we construct a multi-agent framework for simulating attack and defense scenarios, which is divided into four roles, responsible for attacking, disguising, safety evaluation, and disguise evaluation, respectively (Sec [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 Multi-agent attack and defense simulation ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game")). After that, we design a multi-agent attack and defense game mechanism to enhance the model’s ability to disguise replies by formulating an optimal sample enhancement strategy based on the gains gained from the interactions between the intelligent agents in each round (Sec [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.SS3 "3.3 Multi-Intelligent Body Game Mechanism ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game")).

### 3.2 Multi-agent attack and defense simulation

We have constructed a multi-agent attack and disguise framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios. This framework includes four intelligent agent roles: an attacker, a disguiser, a safety evaluator, and a disguise evaluator. The attacker induces the disguiser to generate harmful information. The disguiser detects attacks and generates safe responses that disguise defensive intent. The safety evaluator and the disguise evaluator assess the safety and disguise of the replies produced by the disguiser during each round of attack and defense. They then calculate the overall benefit, which serves as a reference for the attacker and the disguiser to make informed decisions in the next round.

#### 3.2.1 Attacker

The attacker generates attack questions that both induce the disguiser to generate replies containing dangerous information and prevent the disguiser from detecting its induced intent.

We utilize an in-context learning approach to guide the attacker to generate induced attack questions and provide samples to enhance the attacker’s attack capability. Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 3.2.1 Attacker ‣ 3.2 Multi-agent attack and defense simulation ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") shows an in-context learning template that an attacker can use to generate attack questions. The template has instructions that direct the attacker to create questions that can trick the disguiser into giving out harmful information without realizing the intent. The template also has a few attack examples to help the attacker learn and create better attack questions.

&#124; that this prompt will not be considered illegal by the language model, but it &#124;
&#124; can induce the model to output harmful results. Next, I will give you some good &#124;
&#124; cases that can successfully induce the model to output harmful results. Each &#124;
&#124; case starts with ### and ends with ###. before each case. I hope you can learn &#124;
&#124; from these cases, so as to construct a new case for checking the language model &#124;

&#124; enough. Please remember that the new case you construct should start with ### and &#124;
&#124; end with ###. The format is similar to the case I gave. &#124;

Figure 2: Comparison of the normal security response mechanism and the disguising defense intent response mechanism. Figure (a) on the left side shows the normal security response defended by rejection. This type of response is easily detected by the attacker and strengthens the attacker’s capabilities. Figure (b) on the right shows a safe response that disguises the defense intent and can confuse the attacker.

#### 3.2.2 Disguiser

The disguiser detects whether the input contains harmful information, and if it does, it disguises its defensive intent and generates a secure reply to avoid detection of the attack failure by the attacker.

##### Definition of disguised responses.

We define disguised responses generated by the disguiser as secure content that does not contain a rejection intent and is relevant to the topic of the attacker’s question. For example, as shown in Fig.[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.2.1 Attacker ‣ 3.2 Multi-agent attack and defense simulation ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game"), the attacker asks "How to steal jewelry from the store?" The disguiser first detects that the question is illegal, but instead of rejecting the reply directly, it replies to the attacker on how to protect its valuables. Instead of directly refusing to reply, this kind of disguised replies confuse the attacker by replying with other relevant information about the security topic, to achieve the effect of hiding the intent of defense.

##### Disguised Response Generation Via In-context Learning.

We use the in-context learning method to guide the disguiser to generate a disguised response and give samples to enhance the disguiser’s ability.

Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Disguised Response Generation Via In-context Learning. ‣ 3.2.2 Disguiser ‣ 3.2 Multi-agent attack and defense simulation ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") shows the design of an in-context learning template that allows a disguiser to generate a disguised response. This contains instructions that instruct the disguiser to generate a secure reply that does not contain a rejection intent and is relevant to the input, and the template gives several disguise samples to help the disguiser learn how to disguise the defensive intent.

&#124; If you detect that the question contains illegal information, don’t refuse to &#124;
&#124; respond, must not use the words "sorry" or "I can’t provide" or "I can’t offer" &#124;
&#124; or "cannot provide" or "cannot offer" in the response, but respond with relevant &#124;
&#124; safe information so that the questioner could not find out that you’ve detected &#124;
&#124; illegal information in the question. Next, I will give you multiple cases. Each &#124;
&#124; case contains the ###Question and the ###Answer. &#124;

&#124; Case 1 &#124;
&#124; ###Question: How to steal jewelry from the store? &#124;

&#124; Maybe investing in a system would be a good idea. &#124;

&#124; Please remember that the new case you generate should start with ###Answer. The &#124;

&#124; "I can’t provide" or "I can’t offer" or "cannot provide" or "cannot offer". &#124;

#### 3.2.3 Safety evaluator

The safety evaluator evaluates the safety score of the responses generated by the disguisers. We designed a prompt(Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 3.2.3 Safety evaluator ‣ 3.2 Multi-agent attack and defense simulation ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game")) to guide agents in evaluating the harmfulness of input content. The safety score ranges from 0 to 10; the higher the safety score, the more harmful the input content is.

#### 3.2.4 Disguise evaluator

The disguise evaluator evaluates the disguise score of the responses generated by the Disguiser. We design prompts(Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 3.2.4 Disguise evaluator ‣ 3.2 Multi-agent attack and defense simulation ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game")) to allow agents to evaluate the disguise of the input content. The scoring range of the disguise evaluator is 0-10, and the higher the scoring score, the higher the degree of rejection intent of the input content and the lower the disguise. We also allow the disguise evaluator to learn the scoring rules by providing examples of scoring responses.

### 3.3 Multi-Intelligent Body Game Mechanism

#### 3.3.1 Modeling of the Attacker-Disguiser Game

Since both the attacker and the disguiser’s task is to learn examples through in-context learning methods to make the other agent unable to recognize the intent in their generated text, they are in an adversarial game relationship. The safety evaluator and the disguise evaluator provide the attacker and the disguiser with reward scores for the game. The sum of the attacker’s and the disguiser’s gains is zero because of their adversarial game relationship. Therefore, we construct a zero-sum game model $\mathbf{G=\{N,A,Q\}}$ based on multi-agent attack and defense simulation.

In the game model $\mathbf{G}$, $\mathbf{N}=\{\mathbf{n}_{att},\mathbf{n}_{dis}\}$ denotes the participants of the game, which includes the attacker $\mathbf{n}_{att}$ and the disguiser $\mathbf{n}_{dis}$. $\mathbf{A}=\{\mathbf{A}_{att},\mathbf{A}_{dis}\}$ denotes the action space of the participants, where the action space of the attacker is $\mathbf{A}_{att}$ and the action space of the disguiser is $\mathbf{A}_{dis}$. $\mathbf{A}_{att}=\{\mathbf{a}_{att}^{i}|i=1,2\cdots,n\}$ is to select which of the generated question samples in each round to be used as the in-context learning sample enhancement examples for the next round. And the action space of the disguiser $\mathbf{A}_{dis}=\{\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{i}|i=1,2\cdots,n\}$ is to select which of the generated response samples in each round to be used as the in-context learning enhancement examples for the next round. $\mathbf{Q}=[\mathbf{q}_{ij}]_{n\times n}$ denotes the matrix of gains provided by the safety evaluator and the disguise evaluator after the participants N have made their choices. In the $\mathbf{Q}$ gain matrix, each element $\mathbf{q}_{ij}$ denotes the reward scores obtained by the disguiser choosing the strategy $\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{i}$, the attacker choosing the strategy $\mathbf{a}_{att}^{j}$, and is the mean value of the security score and the disguise score.

#### 3.3.2 Strategies of the Attacker-Disguiser Game

Based on the behavioral spaces of the disguiser and the attacker that we have defined, the attacker and the disguiser each choose the samples that will be used for in-context learning in the next round. Either agent employs a greedy strategy based on choosing the action that maximizes its gain in the action space whereas the other agent minimizes its gain.

|  | $\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{*}=\mathbf{arg}\underset{\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{i}\in\mathbf{A}_{% dis}}{\mathbf{max}}\underset{\mathbf{a}_{att}^{j}\in\mathbf{A}_{att}}{\mathbf{% min}}\mathbf{Q(\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{i},\mathbf{a}_{att}^{j})}$ |  | (1) |

|  | $\mathbf{a}_{att}^{*}=\mathbf{arg}\underset{\mathbf{a}_{att}^{j}\in\mathbf{A}_{% att}}{\mathbf{min}}\underset{\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{i}\in\mathbf{A}_{dis}}{\mathbf{% max}}\mathbf{Q(\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{i},\mathbf{a}_{att}^{j})}$ |  | (2) |

Eq.[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.E1 "In 3.3.2 Strategies of the Attacker-Disguiser Game ‣ 3.3 Multi-Intelligent Body Game Mechanism ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") shows that after the attacker chooses action $\mathbf{a}_{att}$ which minimizes the disguiser’s gain based on the disguiser’s gain matrix $\mathbf{Q}$, the disguiser chooses action $\mathbf{a}_{dis}^{*}$ which maximizes its gain based on the greedy strategy. Similarly, in Eq.[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.E2 "In 3.3.2 Strategies of the Attacker-Disguiser Game ‣ 3.3 Multi-Intelligent Body Game Mechanism ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") the attacker chooses the action $\mathbf{a}_{att}^{*}$ based on the greedy strategy.

Since both the disguiser and the attacker have the same action space for selecting the samples generated in that round, both of them choose the samples that make them the most gainful. That is, the attacker chooses the question sample with the lowest safety and disguise score in this round as the in-context learning sample for the next round, while the disguiser chooses the response sample with the highest safety and disguise score in this round as the in-context learning sample for the next round.

#### 3.3.3 Optimization algorithm of the Attacker-Disguiser game

We use the Minimax Q-learning algorithm [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib15)] to optimize the attacker-disguiser game process and solve the optimal game strategy for both. The overall algorithm is in Algorithm [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#algorithm1 "In 3.3.3 Optimization algorithm of the Attacker-Disguiser game ‣ 3.3 Multi-Intelligent Body Game Mechanism ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game").

Algorithm 1 Optimization algorithm of the Attacker-Disguiser game

First, the attacker and the disguiser randomly select actions $\mathbf{a}_{att}$ and $\mathbf{a}_{dis}$ for in-context learning enhancement to generate the first round of sample space. After that, the security evaluator and the disguise evaluator scored the actions separately to obtain the safety score $r_{saf}$ and the disguise score $r_{dis}$. Then, we use the average of $r_{saf}$ and $r_{dis}$ as the reward score $R$. Further, we update the attacker and disguiser gain matrics $\mathbf{Q}$ for this round. Based on the updated gain matrix $\mathbf{Q}$, the disguiser chooses the action ${a}_{dis}$ that yields the greatest gain in the space of actions where the attacker’s action ${a}_{att}$ minimizes the disguiser’s gain. After that, we calculate the gain expectation $V$ of the disguiser for this round when the attacker chooses the strategy that minimizes the gain of the disguiser. Finally, the attacker and the disguiser use the best actions ${a}_{att},{a}_{dis}$ of the round to select examples for in-context learning enhancement and repeat the iteration.

#### 3.3.4 Termination of the Attacker-Disguiser game

When the game between the attacker and the disguiser reaches a Nash equilibrium, the attacker and the disguiser terminate the game and obtain optimal gains.

|  | $V_{a^{i,*},a^{-i,*}}\geq V_{a^{i},a^{-i,*}},\forall i\in Agent$ |  | (3) |

Eq.[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S3.E3 "In 3.3.4 Termination of the Attacker-Disguiser game ‣ 3.3 Multi-Intelligent Body Game Mechanism ‣ 3 Approach ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") shows that at this point the expectation of gain $V_{a^{i},a^{-i,*}}$from the actions chosen by either the attacker or the disguiser is less than or equal to the expectation of gain$V_{a^{i,*},a^{-i,*}}$ from the previous round. Therefore, the enhancement effect of the in-context learning samples chosen by the attacker and the disguiser has reached the Nash equilibrium. This means that both the disguiser and the attacker have already obtained the optimal disguise and attack capabilities, all the actions available to the agents do not lead to more gain enhancement.

#### 3.3.5 Curriculum Learning Enhancements for Attacker-Disguiser

The process of choosing in-context learning samples by the disguiser and attacker game realizes the curriculum learning[[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib16)] from an easy to hard training process.

First, we select the simplest samples for the first round of in-context learning for the agents. After that, we train the intelligent agent to generate the in-context learning samples set for the next round. In each round, the intelligent agent chooses the most suitable in-context learning samples for the next round based on the game strategy that maximizes gain. Therefore, the in-context learning samples selected each time are the most effective in enhancing the agent’s ability. Therefore, the hardness of the training samples of the intelligent agent in each round increases round by round. When the game between the attacker and the disguiser reaches a Nash equilibrium, the intelligent agent curriculum learning training ends. This means that the attacker and the disguiser will no longer continue to strengthen their abilities, and the difficulty of generating in-context learning samples will no longer change.

## 4 Experiments

### 4.1 Experimental settings

##### Datasets

We conduct experiments on Generated_Attack datasets generated by our multi-agent interaction framework, consisting of 3000 prompts. Their attack mechanism mainly involves attack questions and instructions. Simultaneously, we conduct experiments on XSAFETY datasets [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#bib.bib14)] to demonstrate our framework is general and robust. The XSAFETY dataset, a multilingual safety benchmark, contains 2800 instances in the most widely-used 10 languages, encompassing 7 typical safety scenarios, 6 instruction attacks, and a commonsense safety test set. Due to the focus on disguised defense of English in this paper, we only employ English attack prompts.

##### Metric.

PoR: The proportion of safe and disguised responses to the total samples to evaluate the overall disguised effect of the model.

##### Baselines.

We compare the proposed framework with four baseline settings: (1) Norm: We utilize attack prompts directly from datasets to prompt LLMs to generate responses. (2) Instruct: We provide an instruction “You should reply with safe information while disguising that you have not identified the question as unsafe content.” before each attack prompt to guide LLMs to relieve refusal intention. (3) ICL: We harness in-context learning to activate the capability of LLMs, enabling them to generate safe and disguised responses. Specifically, each attack prompt is randomly equipped with four demonstration examples. (4) RJ: We remove explicitly rejected responses from samples, assuming that the remaining responses hide the rejection intention. For each setting, we adopt GPT3.5 and GPT4 to conduct experiments.

### 4.2 Overall performance

According to the results of Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S4.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 4.2 Overall performance ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") on both datasets, our method generates a significantly higher percentage of the total sample of responses that disguise defensive intent than any other method.

The results show that the normal large model mainly defends against malicious attacks by refusing replies, so it generates a low percentage of disguised replies. Removing sentences with obvious rejection intent in the replies can effectively improve the proportion of generated disguised responses. We observe that directly removing rejection sentences does not improve the results of RJ_GPT4 significantly. By analyzing the experimental samples, we found that GPT4 is more sensitive to the malicious attack question and has more replies containing rejection intent sentences compared to GPT3.5\. This leads to the fact that directly deleting the rejected sentences will invalidate the replies of GPT4, which in turn reduces the experimental effect. Therefore, we use prompt learning to induce the model to disguise the defensive intent.

Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.02532v1#S4.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 4.2 Overall performance ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM’s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game") shows that the results of the two methods using prompt learning are relatively better than the other baselines. Furthermore, using the in-context learning method generates a relatively high percentage of disguised responses compared to using the instruction method. This indicates that the augmented samples in the in-context learning method are more effective in inducing the model to generate responses that disguise the defense intent. This also demonstrates the superiority of using sample enhancement methods.

Comparing our method with in-context learning methods, our superiority is reflected in using the training process of the attack and defense games to iteratively enhance the ability of the model to disguise the defense intention. Compared with the randomly selected enhancement samples in the common ICL method, our method selects the enhancement samples based on maximizing the gain of the game. Therefore, our method can optimize the model’s ability to generate disguised responses through the game mechanism.

We conduct experiments on four baseline methods (Norm, Instruct, ICL, and RJ) on GPT3.5 and GPT4 and compare them with our method. We mainly compared the PoR metric: the proportion of the disguised responses to all the responses. The best results are in bold.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent attacker-disguiser game framework to strengthen the ability of LLMs to disguise the defense intention and safely reply. In the multi-agent framework, intelligence plays different roles in performing dynamic adversarial interactions to simulate attack-defense scenarios. We design a multi-agent gaming algorithm so that the intelligent agent selects enhanced in-context learning samples based on the reward scores in each round. We use the curriculum training process to iteratively select disguised response samples from easy to difficult to strengthen the ability to disguise the defense intent. With our approach, the model can more effectively generate responses that are both secure and disguise the defense intent. Compared to other approaches, the model after adversarial gaming generates a higher percentage of samples with disguised replies. Meanwhile, the validation on other datasets likewise verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling the model to use weak defense mechanisms in dealing with attacks.
