## 1\. Introduction

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying, measuring, and promoting well-being, which could be defined as a comprehensive state in which all aspects of a person’s life are considered good, encompassing physical, emotional, and social dimensions (VanderWeele2017; VanderWeele2019). Within this broad concept, mental well-being is when individuals experience positive emotions, positive psychological functioning, and positive social functioning most of the time. The significance of mental well-being lies in its essential role in enabling individuals to manage stress effectively, build meaningful relationships, and make sound decisions.

Research in positive psychology and well-being studies has provided valuable insights into the determinants of well-being and how individuals can improve it(Ryan2000; Prochaska1997). These studies have identified a range of evidence-based strategies for enhancing well-being, highlighting the potential for individuals to take proactive steps toward improving their mental health. However, despite the abundance of information and evidence-based strategies for enhancing well-being, a significant challenge remains: many individuals struggle to consistently adopt these practices. This gap between knowledge and action highlights the need for effective strategies to translate understanding into behavior, which should address not only the individual’s capability and opportunity but also their motivation to engage in behavior change (Knittle2018; Ryan2000; Prochaska1997).

To address this gap, numerous innovative technologies, ranging from mobile apps to conversational agents, are designed to recommend a variety of activities based on user-specific characteristics and situations, including physical activity, cognitive exercises, behavioral exercises, etc., as interventions aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles, behaviors, and general mental well-being.

Initially, mobile apps paved the way for accessible health management tools. For example, MyFitnessPal offers features for tracking physical activity and dietary intake, empowering users to maintain a balanced lifestyle (Pagoto2013). While these apps provide valuable resources, they often lack real-time interaction and personalized guidance, limiting their ability to adapt to changing user needs.

The advent of AI-powered chatbots marked a significant advancement in this domain. Chatbots, such as Lark, utilize conversational AI to offer personalized health coaching, encouraging users to adopt healthier behaviors (Hamine2015). These chatbots can provide instant feedback and support, making health management more interactive. However, their rule-based nature often leads to limitations such as lack of deep personalization (Fitzpatrick2017; Abd-Alrazaq2020), lack of empathy in interactions (Gibson2016), and challenges in ensuring user compliance (Kocielnik2019). While chatbots can address some aspects of the intention-action gap by providing information and reminders, they may fall short in fostering sustained behavior change and emotional engagement.

The rise of LLM-based conversational agents(CA) has shown the potential to address key challenges to promote behaviors or activities in supporting mental well-being, such as the lack of personalization and the lack of user compliance with recommendations. In general, LLM-based CA could better engage users in meaningful conversations, provide personalized suggestions, and help users develop strategies for managing physical and mental health challenges, such as stress, anxiety, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle(Miner2020). This personalized approach has the potential to prompt positive psychological outcomes and contribute to overall happiness and well-being, encouraging users to adopt healthier behaviors (Miner2020). One significant advantage of LLM-based agents is their ability to embody anthropomorphic features, which can enhance their effectiveness as tools for promoting healthy behaviors. Anthropomorphism in LLM-based conversational agents generally refers to the integration of human-like characteristics such as acting as a companion or coach, providing prompts, and exhibiting empathy. By appearing more human-like, these agents could foster a deeper sense of connection and trust with users, thereby increasing compliance and engagement with recommended activities.

Despite we see the potential, there is a limited number of empirical user studies investigating the effectiveness of anthropomorphism of LLM-based CA to promote behaviors in supporting mental well-being.

To further explore the potentials of anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agents in supporting mental well-being, in this study, we conduct a longitudinal user study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthropomorphism in LLM-based conversational agents in promoting positive psychological exercises for mental well-being support in terms of the willingness to take actions, action-taking, mood change, and general perceptions of anthropomorphism of LLM-based CA. Our definition of anthropomorphism in LLM-based conversational agents encompasses functionalities such as prompting, embodiment, persona, and companionship. To illustrate this, we introduce Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent specifically designed for mental well-being support through cognitive exercises recommendation and providing coaching to assist users in practicing these exercises. Sunnie leverages the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 to engage users in natural and meaningful conversations, adapting dynamically to their needs and preferences. It features a distinct persona with a name and a unique communication style, characterized by the use of emojis, to enhance relatability and engagement. Additionally, Sunnie is visually represented by an image that embodies its appearance, contributing to a more immersive anthropomorphic experience. Beyond conversation, Sunnie acts as a coach, accompanying and instructing users in practicing the recommended daily cognitive exercises, moving beyond the traditional do-it-yourself approach. Through these features, Sunnie aims to offer a personalized and human-like interaction that effectively supports users in improving their mental well-being and adopting flourishing behaviors.

In this paper, we aim to study the effectiveness of anthropomorphism in LLM-based conversational agents in promoting psychological activity for mental well-being support in terms of action-taking, mood change, perceived helpfulness and general expectations of LLM-based CA. We introduced Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent
