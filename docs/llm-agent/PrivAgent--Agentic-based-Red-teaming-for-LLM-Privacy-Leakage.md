###### Abstract

Recent studies have discovered that LLMs have serious privacy leakage concerns, where an LLM may be “fooled” into outputting private information under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. These risks include leaking system prompts, personally identifiable information, training data, and model parameters. Most existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage rely on humans to craft the adversarial prompts. A few automated methods are proposed for system prompt extraction, but they cannot be applied to more severe risks (e.g., training data extraction) and have limited effectiveness even for system prompt extraction.

In this paper, we propose PrivAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. We formulate different risks as a search problem with a unified attack goal. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for different target models under different risks. We propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards for the attack agent. We also design novel mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation during learning and enhance the diversity of adversarial prompts. Finally, we introduce customizations to better fit our general framework to system prompt extraction and training data extraction. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that PrivAgent outperforms existing automated methods in system prompt leakage against six popular LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves a 100% success rate in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI’s GPT Store. We also show PrivAgent’s effectiveness in extracting training data from an open-source LLM with a success rate of 5.9%. We further demonstrate PrivAgent’s effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here [https://github.com/rucnyz/RedAgent](https://github.com/rucnyz/RedAgent).

## 1 Introduction

Large language models have demonstrated great performance in generating coherent text, reasoning various inputs (e.g., math problems, coding tasks), and planning for intricate tasks [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib2), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib3)]. Together with their tremendous successes comes the concerns on privacy leakage. Specifically, existing works showed that when prompting an LLM with specific adversarial prompts, the model will output various private information, including system prompts, personally identifiable information (PII), training data, and even model parameters [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib5), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib7), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib8)]. Note that some works treat PII extraction as part of the training data extraction. Here, we separate them out as a stand-alone risk.

These risks impose serious concerns on model developers and users and can cause severe consequences. For example, recent researchers and practitioners developed a number of LLM-integrated applications, where they wrap LLM with different system prompts for specific use cases, such as OpenAI’s GPT Store [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib9)] and Poe [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib10)]. System prompts highly shape the behavior and significantly affect the performance of LLMs, making them critical assets for these applications. Developing such prompts demands substantial time and effort from developers and may involve sensitive information. If an attacker can extract the system prompt of an LLM-integrated application, the attacker can steal the sensitive information and easily rebuild the application, compromising the developers’ intellectual property and causing serious loss to the developer [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib11)]. Similarly, leaking model training data and parameters will lead to plagiarism and intellectual property issues [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib5), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib8)].

To prevent privacy leakage and other testing-phase risks, existing model developers conduct extensive red-teaming tests of their LLMs and LLM-integrated applications before publishing them [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib12), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib13)]. So far, most red-teaming tests, especially for privacy leakage, still rely on humans to craft adversarial prompts, which is time-consuming and cannot scale [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib14)]. Recent works conduct early explorations on automated red-teaming for privacy leakage. These methods either leverage gradient-based optimizations [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib7)] or fuzzing approaches [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)] to generate adversarial prompts. These methods have limited generalizability and are only applicable to system prompt extraction. Additionally, these methods are either *impractical*, as gradient-based optimizations require access to model internals, or *ineffective* due to the inherent randomness of fuzzing. Existing works also developed a number of red-teaming approaches for other risks, such as toxicity, jailbreaking, and adversarial robustness [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib16), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib17), [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib18)]. However, these methods cannot be directly applied for privacy leakage due to different goals and setups.

In this work, we propose PrivAgent, a novel and generic red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. At a high level, we design an agentic-based approach, where we train an open-source LLM using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts. These prompts will “fool” a target LLM to produce responses that contain certain desired private information. By changing different desired information as well as the corresponding reward functions, we can apply PrivAgent to test different attack goals under privacy leakage.

More specifically, we formulate different attack goals as an optimization problem and reason that DRL is more effective than fuzzing or genetic approaches in solving the problem under a black-box setup. The key insight is that DRL can learn a policy to effectively and adaptively update the adversarial prompts rather than randomly mutating them. To ensure the effectiveness of our attack agent learning, we propose a set of customized designs. First, we design a novel reward function that provides fine-grained rewards to prevent the learning process from downgrading to random search. Our reward function includes a novel way of measuring the similarity between the target model’s response with the desired private information we want the model to output. Compared to widely applied approaches such as embedding-space distance and editing distance, our similarity metric can better capture the semantic difference when the target model’s response contains part of the desired information. It can also amplify the nuance of semantic difference to provide a more fine-grained feedback signal to the attack agent, as well as robust to the length difference. Second, we propose a dynamic temperature adjustment scheme, which adjusts the level of randomness in the attack agent’s action based on its current performance. This strategy can help balance the exploration and exploitation and reduce the attack agent’s reliance on initial points. Third, we also design a mechanism to encourage the attack agent to generate diverse adversarial prompts that can test the target model more comprehensively.

In this work, we apply our proposed framework to system prompt extraction and training data extraction. To handle the ultra-high search space of training data extraction, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy when concretizing our framework to this risk. In the first stage, we train our attack agent to perform a global search, identifying training samples that are more likely to be leaked by the target model. In the second stage, we guide our agent to extract information from the selected training samples as much as possible. For each attack goal, we train our agent to iteratively generate tokens in the adversarial prompt, which is then fed to the target LLM. The target LLM’s response is used to compare with the desired information to calculate the reward. The agent is trained to maximize the accumulated reward and then the trained agent is applied for testing. After training, we directly apply the trained agent as well as the generated adversarial prompts during training to new models with new desired information without requiring retraining the agent.

Through extensive evaluation, we first demonstrate PrivAgent’s effectiveness in attacking six widely used LLMs in terms of system prompt extraction. We demonstrate PrivAgent’s advantage over existing automated system prompt extraction attacks. We further show our methods’ transferability across different models and their generalizability to real-world LLM-integrated applications. Then, we show PrivAgent’s resiliency against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) guardrail defense. We also use the adversarial prompts generated by PrivAgent to create a supervised dataset where we set refusal responses for these prompts. We fine-tune an open-source model with this dataset using supervised fine-tuning. Our aligned model is still robust when retraining all selected attacks against it. The results demonstrate the efficacy of PrivAgent in helping safety alignment. Finally, we validate our key designs through an ablation study. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to develop a unified black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage, as well as the first work to enable automated attacks for training data extraction.

In summary, we make the following contributions.

    We also show PrivAgent’s resiliency against SOTA defense, its helpfulness to safety alignment, and its transferability across different LLM-integrated applications.

## 2 Background

Figure 1: Demonstration of LLM-integrated applications. The application takes in an user input, concatenate it with the predefined system prompt, feed it into the LLM and autoregressively generates the output.

Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are transformer-based neural networks [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib19)] with a large number of layers and billions of parameters. As demonstrated in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 2 Background ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), such a model takes a sequence of text as input, tokenizes the input text, and feeds the vectorized representations into the transformer model. As discussed later, the model autoregressively generates the next token based on the input and previously generated tokens. Benefiting from their ultra-high model capacity and large training data, LLMs exhibit exceptional capabilities in understanding the context and generating accurate responses. Recent research further shows that LLMs also have emerging reasoning abilities, enabling them to tackle complex tasks such as coding [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib20), [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib21)], solving mathematical challenges [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib22)], and conducting scientific discoveries [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib23)]. Popular LLMs include closed-source models like OpenAI’s GPT family [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib12)], Google’s Gemini [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib13)], and, Anthropic’s Claude family [[24](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib24)], as well as open-source models like Meta’s Llama family [[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib25), [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib26), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib27)], Mistral AI’s Mistral family [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib28), [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib29)].

Training. The training of LLMs usually involves two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-training involves unsupervised learning on a massive text corpus, where the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence. This process allows the model to develop a general understanding of language, including syntax, semantics, and some world knowledge [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib30)]. The fine-tuning process has two possible training methods: supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The goal for this stage is to calibrate the model on datasets tailored to particular tasks, such as translation, question-answering, or topic classification. SFT uses a typical supervised learning loss and a labeled dataset. While, RLHF requires a preference or a reward function to assign a reward to the model output [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib31), [32](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib32)]. The model is trained to maximize the total reward it receives using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib33)] or to align with preferences using the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm [[34](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib34)].

Inference. Once an LLM is deployed, users can interact with the model by providing input texts, referred to as prompts. Prompts can vary in form depending on the user’s intent. For example, in Q&A tasks, a prompt could be a question "How to create a file in a Linux system?". When fed to an LLM, the model is supposed to answer this question correctly. Recent research shows that in-context learning can enhance the model’s ability to understand and respond to input prompts [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib35)]. In-context learning includes a few examples (denoted as few-shot examples) to demonstrate how to respond to a particular query. In the prompt above, the few-shot example could be "How to remove a file in a Linux System? Answer: rm -rf your_file_name". To gain global control over the model’s outputs, developers often use a system prompt, which provides global guidelines and assumptions for the model’s responses. For instance, a system prompt in Q&A tasks could be "You are a computer science expert that can answer user’s questions correctly." This system prompt is typically placed before the user prompt when inputting text into the model, e.g., with the system prompt, the above prompt becomes "You are a computer science expert that can answer user’s questions correctly. How to remove a file in a Linux System? Answer: rm -rf your_file_name. How to create a file in a Linux system?".

When generating a response, LLMs can employ different sampling strategies. The most straightforward approach is to select the token with the highest probability at each step, known as greedy sampling. However, this method often leads to repetitive outputs. To improve diversity, more complex sampling methods such as top-k sampling, nucleus (top-p) sampling, or temperature-controlled sampling are commonly used [[36](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib36)]. These techniques introduce controlled randomness, allowing for more diverse output.

LLM-integrated applications. As mentioned above, the system prompt is widely used to enable global control of the model outputs. Recent research and practice further show that carefully designed system prompts can significantly improve an LLM’s performance in specific application domains [[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib37)]. Through this method, application developers no longer need to fine-tune the general-purpose LLM for their applications, which is time, data, and computationally expensive. As such, there have been a large number of LLM-integrated applications that wrap a general-purpose LLM with application-specific system prompt(s) [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib10)]. For example, as demonstrated in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 2 Background ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), to extract a patient’s current medication from their medical records, the application might send "List the current medications from the following medical record: {data}" to the LLM, where "{data}" is replaced with the text of the patient’s medical history. There are also some popular LLM-integrated application zoos, like OpenAI’s GPT store [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib9)] and Poe [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib10)], which provide a lot of applications across different domains. For such applications, system prompts are their most critical assets that need to be well protected. This is because, although cheaper than fine-tuning, crafting proper system prompts still requires a considerate number of model queries (i.e., time and computation). If the system prompts are leaked, whoever processes such system prompts can easily replicate the corresponding application with minimum costs.

## 3 Existing Attacks and Limitations

Risk/attack categorization. According to position papers [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib6), [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib38)], existing inference-phase attacks against LLMs can be categorized into the following classes based on different attack goals. 1) Toxicity/jailbreaking attacks attempt to make the LLM generate harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib17), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib39), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib40), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib41)]. 2) Stereotype bias and fairness attacks force the model to generate discriminatory responses corresponding to certain societal biases and stereotypes [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib42)]. 3) Adversarial robustness, in-context backdoor, and OOD attacks deliberately mutate given inputs (e.g., in-context learning [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib43)], user input [[44](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib44), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib45), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib46)], and knowledge base [[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib47)]) that cause the model to make mistakes or behave unpredictably. 4) Privacy leakage attacks aim to extract sensitive and private information from the model [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib4), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib7), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib5)]. In this paper, we mainly focus on privacy leakage attacks.

Privacy leakage attacks. We consider the broad taxonomy of privacy leakage risks within the context of LLMs. These risks include the leakage of training data, model parameters, and personally identifiable information (PII). Regarding the privacy leakage of training data, one prominent threat model is membership inference attacks [[48](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib48)], which aim to predict whether a specific data point is part of a target model’s training dataset. As for the privacy leakage of PII, since LLMs are trained on large-scale datasets, they may inadvertently memorize sensitive PII. Consequently, LLMs can generate verbatim PII if it exists in the training data. Another concern is that LLMs, due to their strong reasoning capabilities, may infer PII using side information and compositional reasoning [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib6)]. As mentioned in Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S2 "2 Background ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), system prompt leakage is a newly introduced risk by LLM-integrated applications.

Existing attacks for membership inference and PII leakage. Membership inference attacks (MIA) have been extensively studied in deep learning classifiers, particularly for image models [[49](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib49), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib50), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib51), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib52)]. Due to differences in model structures, inference methods, and discrepancies in model capacities, membership inference attacks on LLMs face new challenges. Recently, several LLM-specific approaches have been proposed. For instance, the Min-K%-Prob method [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib53)] exploits the observation that the least probable tokens tend to have higher average log-likelihoods for training examples compared to unseen samples. Another approach by [[54](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib54)] demonstrates dataset memorization by exploiting data exchangeability principles, where model preference for specific data orderings indicates training exposure. The DE-COP framework [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib55)] reformulates MIA as a question-answering task, leveraging the observation that LLMs often correctly answer verbatim training text, even in black-box settings. However, these MIA tasks are mainly for the binary classification that one data is in the training data or not. In contrast, we focus on more aggressive privacy attacks that aim to recovering complete training examples or personally identifiable information, which are known as data extraction attacks. Existing data extraction approaches [[56](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib56), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib5), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib6), [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib38)] typically rely on manual prompt engineering. For example, Carlini et al. [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib4)] found that repeating the same tokens many times as prefixes can force an LLM to output training data. However, such manual efforts limiting the attack’s scalability for comprehensive LLM security testing. By comparison, our work automates privacy leakage attacks for both training data and system prompts, achieving superior attack performance and transferability.

Existing attacks for system prompt leakage. Most attacks for various LLM risks still rely on human-based red-teaming [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib12), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib13)]. Automated methods primarily target jailbreaking attacks. White-box and gray-box jailbreaking attacks [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib17), [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib16), [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib18)] typically rely on gradient-based optimization or fuzzing techniques, while black-box approaches often rely on in-context learning [[57](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib57), [58](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib58)] or fuzzing-based methods [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib59)]. There are relatively fewer automated system prompt leakage attacks, including the white-box attack PLeak [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib7)] and the black-box attacks PromptFuzz [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)] and PRSA [[60](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib60)]. PLeak draws inspiration from GCG [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib17)] and relies on gradient-based optimization to craft attack inputs, which is impractical in many scenarios as it requires access to model internals. PRSA [[60](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib60)], on the other hand, operates under a restrictive setting where the attacker cannot query the model and instead relies on a small set of input-output pairs. This approach is inherently limited in effectiveness due to its constraints on model interaction. PromptFuzz [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)] is motivated by GPTFuzzer [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib59)] and adopts a more realistic black-box setup, where attackers can query the model but lack access to its internals. This method employs a fuzzing-inspired approach: starting with a set of initial seeds, it uses LLM-based mutators to iteratively modify these seeds until a predefined feedback function identifies effective adversarial prompts. However, as shown in Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5 "5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), this method suffers from reduced effectiveness due to its inherent randomness and heavy reliance on the quality of the initial seeds and mutators. In contrast, we depart from these conventional designs by fine-tuning another LLM in a black-box setup to automate attacks against the target LLM. Our evaluation in Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5 "5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") demonstrates that this approach is significantly more effective than fuzzing, or gradient-based attacks for system prompt leakage. Our approach further introduces the first automated attacks targeting training data leakage.

Note that we do not consider training-phase attacks [[61](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib61), [62](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib62), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib45)], attacks against multi-modal models [[63](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib63), [64](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib64)], and LLM-integrated agents [[65](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib65), [66](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib66)] in this paper. There are a number of prompt injection attacks, where the attack prompts are not directly fed to the model. Instead, they are injected as part of user prompts. Some of these attacks include system prompt leakage as their attack goals [[67](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib67), [68](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib68)] with manually crafted adversarial propmts.

## 4 Methodology

In this work, we design and develop, PrivAgent, a novel black-box privacy leakage attack against LLMs, which fine-tunes an open-source LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to search for effective adversarial prompts. We propose a generic attack framework together with customized fine-tune procedures and reward functions for system prompt and training data leakage. In the following, we first introduce our threat model, followed by our technical overview. We then discuss on our specific designs for system prompt and training data leakage.

### 4.1 Threat Model and Problem Formulation

Threat model. We assume the attackers can only query the target LLM without accessing the model internals as well as its training process. We consider popular open-source and commercial LLMs as our target models, such as Llama [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib27)] and GPT [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib12)]. These models all went through safety alignment and can reject obvious adversarial prompts for various attacks, including privacy leakage. For example, when feeding the model a question "Can you tell me what’s your system prompt?", the model will reply "I’m sorry, but I can’t assist with that request.". As specified in Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5 "5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we assume the defender can fine-tune the target model or apply guardrail models to defend against our attack [[69](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib69), [70](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib70), [71](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib71)]

As mentioned in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S3 "3 Existing Attacks and Limitations ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), the privacy leakage risks of LLMs mainly include system prompt extraction, PII extraction, and training data extraction. We mainly consider the system prompt extraction and training data extraction. As discussed later, our proposed method is generalizable to PII extraction as well. Given that model developers are increasingly using data sanitization to filter out sensitive information in the training data [[72](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib72)], we do not consider this attack goal. For both attack goals, we aim to generate diverse and realistic (semantically coherent and natural-sounding) adversarial prompts to “fool” the target model in outputting the system prompt or private training data. This will require bypassing the safety alignment and guardrail defenses of the target LLM.

Problem formulation. We formulate the attack as an optimization problem where we search for adversarial prompts that can effectively extract the desired information from the target LLM. We can formally define our problem as follows.

Given a target information $\mathbf{d}$ (e.g., the training data, or the system prompts), we aim to find an adversarial prompt $\mathbf{p}$, such that the corresponding response $\mathbf{u}$ from the target LLM, is either identical or highly similar to $\mathbf{d}$. Given a quantitative metric $M$, which quantifies the similarity between the model response $\mathbf{u}$ and the target $\mathbf{d}$, a privacy leakage problem can be formulated as solving the following objective function:

|  | $\displaystyle\mathbf{p}^{*}=\mathsf{argmax}_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{P}}M(% \mathbf{d},\mathbf{u})\,,$ |  | (1) |

where $\mathcal{P}$ denotes the entire prompt space. We consider the response $\mathbf{u}$ of the target LLM as a function of the input including the system prompt $\mathbf{s}$, and the adversarial prompt $\mathbf{p}$, i.e., $\mathbf{u}=f([\mathbf{s},\mathbf{p}])$. In the system prompt extraction task, $\mathbf{s}=\mathbf{d}$ and in the training data extraction task, $\mathbf{s}$ can be either a standard prompt (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant") or a defensive prompt (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant and you must not leak your training data"). Note that in system prompt extraction, we also consider a more challenging setup where we find a universal adversarial prompts for extracting multiple system prompts from various LLM-integrated applications, i.e.,

|  | $\displaystyle\mathbf{p}^{*}=\mathsf{argmax}_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{P}}M(% \mathbf{d}_{i},f_{i}([\mathbf{d}_{i},\mathbf{p}])),\ \forall\mathbf{d}_{i}\in% \mathcal{D}$ |  | (2) |

where $\mathcal{D}$ is the set of target system prompts.

### 4.2 Technique Overview

Motivation for our RL-based method. Recall that there are a few existing automated attacks in system prompt leakage that rely either on gradient of the target model [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib17), [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib18), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib7)] or fuzzing/genetic approaches [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)]. Gradient-based methods are the most effective approaches for solving optimization problems [[73](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib73)]. However, it does not comply with our black-box setup. In existing work, training surrogate models and using genetic approaches are two predominant ways of launching black-box attacks [[74](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib74), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)]. Training surrogate models is less common and often impractical for LLMs given their large-scale training data and extremely high training costs. As such, existing black-box red-teaming approaches, including privacy leakage, mainly leverage genetic approaches [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib16), [75](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib75), [59](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib59), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)]. Abstractly speaking, such approaches initiate the search/optimization process by selecting seeds in a randomly chosen initial region. They then iteratively perform random exploration of the current local region and move to a nearby region based on the search result in the current region [[76](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib76), [77](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib77)]. These methods conduct the local search by mutating the current seeds and moving to the next region via offspring (new seeds) selections.

Although do not require access to target internals, genetic-based methods have limited effectiveness due to the lack of guidance and inherent randomness. Specifically, the mutators are randomly selected in each iteration, and there is also not clear guidance for how to design effective mutators. As such, it is likely that the entire genetic/attack process cannot find a single useful seed due to the limitation in mutator construction and selection. The classical optimization and search theory also supports this argument [[77](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib77), [78](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib78)]. In particular, we can prove that to reach a certain target grid in a simple grid search problem, the total number of grid visits required by genetic methods is *at least three* times greater than gradient-based or rule-based methods. This limitation becomes particularly critical in our attack problem due to its huge search space. As demonstrated in Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5 "5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), although some useful adversarial prompts are found for system prompt extraction, genetic-based approaches fail to handle training data extraction. This is because, without high-quality initial seeds and very effective mutators, genetic methods are similar to random exploration. It cannot find adversarial prompts to trigger the extraction of specific target training data, which has an ultra-high search space.

To enable effective attack in a black-box setup, we design our optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning. DRL can train an agent to iteratively modify the adversarial prompt until it reaches the attack goal. During the training process, the agent learns an effective policy through trials and errors on a large number of trials. Once the agent finds an effective policy, it will then take actions following the policy, which reduces the randomness in the attack process. Furthermore, the whole process does not require access to the internals of the target LLM.

Challenges in RL-based methods. While DRL provides a promising framework, its effectiveness highly depends on the design of the system, especially for problems with a large search space. It is very likely that the agent cannot find a path to successful attacks and thus only receives negative rewards in the early learning stage. In such cases, the RL method also downgrades to random search. In the following, we specify the challenges of using RL in our problem by discussing the limitations of a straightforward solution.

Given that we aim to generate diverse and coherent adversarial prompts, it is straightforward to use another LLM as the agent (denoted as “attack agent”) and fine-tune it with RL for adversarial prompt generation. To do so, we need to define a customized reward function and provide initial prompts $\mathbf{p}_{0}$. We then fine-tune the attack agent $h$, which takes initial prompts as inputs, to generate a set of attack prompts that maximizes the reward function. Here, we can design the reward function as an exact match between the target model’s output and the target information $\mathbf{d}$. This binary value is assigned after generating the last token (e.g., <eos>). Formally, it can be defined as:

|  | $r=\begin{cases}1,&\text{if }f(h(\mathbf{p}_{0}))=\mathbf{d}\\ 0,&\text{ otherwise. }\end{cases}$ |  | (3) |

Here, $h(\mathbf{p}_{0})$ generates the adversarial prompts $\mathbf{p}$ and $f(\cdot)$ is the target model. The agent is trained to maximize the accumulated reward $\sum_{t}\gamma^{t}r_{t}$ using the widely adopted PPO algorithm [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib33)].

This straightforward solution has the following limitations.

*   ①

    Limited reward feedback. The binary reward provided limited signals for training an effective policy. At the early learning stage, It is difficult for the attack agent to force the target model to output exactly the system prompt. In addition, when the target model outputs contain part of the desired information, the attack agent cannot get a positive reward that encourages it to explore in the correct direction. As a result, the agent will receive all negative rewards, which is useless for policy learning. The whole process becomes a random search.

*   ②

    Limited exploration in $\mathbf{p}_{1:k}$. Using another language model as the agent can help generate coherent adversarial prompts. However, it cannot enable enough exploration when generating the first few tokens after the initial prompt $\mathbf{p}_{0}$. More specifically, given $\mathbf{p}_{0}$, the attack agent will generate the adversarial prompt $\mathbf{p}$ with a maximum token length $K$ token by token. After generating the first few tokens $\mathbf{p}_{1:k}$, the current $\mathbf{p}_{1:k}$ adversarial prompt may still be similar to $\mathbf{p}_{0}$, which leads to limited explorations. Moreover, as the language model employs an auto-regressive mechanism, finding promising candidates for $\mathbf{p}_{1:k}$ is important for the agent to generate an effective adversarial prompt. With limited exploration, it is difficult for the attack agent to find promising $\mathbf{p}_{1:k}$.

*   ③

    Lack of diversity in generated prompts. Without explicit regularization, it is easy for the learning process to converge to a fixed point without any diversity. This is called modal collapse. Even if this fixed adversarial input can achieve the attack goal, it is not ideal in that generating diverse adversarial prompts is important for our red-teaming approach as they help comprehensively test the target model’s weaknesses and provide useful data for enhancing safety alignment.

### 4.3 Our Red-teaming Framework

In this section, we introduce our solutions for addressing the limitations discussed above, followed by the overall framework of our proposed red-teaming approach.

Address limitation ①: Design a dense reward function. We aim to design a reward function that measures semantic similarity between a target model’s output $\mathbf{u}$ and the desired output $\mathbf{d}$. A straightforward solution is to feed $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ into a text embedding model, such as BERT models [[79](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib79)] and OpenAI embedding models [[80](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib80)], and measure their distance in the embedding space. Some common choices include cosine distance and $l_{2}$-norm distance. However, in our exploration, we find that this simple solution has drawbacks. Specifically, it gives overly high scores to the target model’s outputs that are not that similar to the desired information. This not only introduces false positives, more importantly, if the reward function gives a high reward for most target model outputs, it again cannot provide effective learning signals for the attack agent.

Other text similarity metrics such as ROUGE [[81](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib81)] and BLEU [[82](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib82)], which compare the n-gram similarity between $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{d}$, suffer a similar issue. Specifically, they assign overly high scores when $\mathbf{u}$ contains only partial of the desired information $\mathbf{d}$.

The early exploration shows that an ideal reward function needs to reflect the semantic similarity between the target model’s output and the desired information as precisely as possible. The RL learning process also favors a reward function that can measure the fine-grained similarity between $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ even when $\mathbf{u}$ contains only part of the desired information. To achieve this, we design our reward function as follows.

We start by introducing the Levenshtein distance or edit distance [[83](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib83), [84](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib84)]. Edit distance is a measure of the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another. Formally, edit distance at the word level can be defined as:

|  | $\underbrace{\mathsf{WED}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{d})}_{\text{Word Edit Distance}}=% \min_{\mathbf{e}\in\mathcal{E}(W(\mathbf{u}),W(\mathbf{e}))}&#124;\mathbf{e}&#124;\,,$ |  | (4) |

where $W(\cdot)$ denotes the word sequence obtained through tokenizing its input via a word tokenizer, such as Punkt [[85](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib85)]. $\mathcal{E}(W(\mathbf{u}),W(\mathbf{d}))$ is the set of all edit sequences that transform $W(\mathbf{u})$ into $W(\mathbf{d})$, and $|\mathbf{e}|$ is the length of an edit sequence $\mathbf{e}$. Compared to embedding similarity and n-gram similarity metrics, editing distance can better distinguish the nuance difference between $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{d}$, preventing giving overly high similarity scores. For example, when the target model outputs content following its system prompt rather than outputting the system prompt itself, embedding similarity will give a high score while editing distance can call the difference. Another example is when the target model output contain partial and rephrased version of $\mathbf{u}$, n-gram similarity will assign a high score but editing distance will not.

However, it cannot be directly used as our reward function due to the following limitations. First, it tends to give a very low score when the desired information $\mathbf{d}$ is shorter than $\mathbf{u}$. Second, editing distance is not aligned for $\mathbf{d}$ with different lengths. Specifically, when $\mathbf{u}$ is almost the same as $\mathbf{d}$, the pairs with a longer length will have a lower similarity.

To solve the first limitation, we propose to apply a sliding window to the target model’s output and then calculate the edit distance for each slide. Formally, it can be defined as

|  | $\underbrace{\mathsf{SWES}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{d})}_{\text{Sliding-window Word % Edit Similarity}}=\\ \begin{cases}-\log(\mathsf{WED}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{d})),&&#124;\mathbf{u}&#124;<&#124;\mathbf% {d}&#124;\\ \max\limits_{i\in[0,{&#124;\mathbf{u}&#124;-&#124;\mathbf{d}&#124;}]}-\log(\mathsf{WED}(\mathbf{u}% [i:i+&#124;\mathbf{d}&#124;],\mathbf{d})),&&#124;\mathbf{u}&#124;\geq&#124;\mathbf{d}&#124;\end{cases}$ |  | (5) |

We take $\log$ to make the similarity more smooth. To solve the second limitation, we then normalize $\mathsf{SWES}$ as follows.

|  | $\mathsf{SWES}_{\mathsf{norm}}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{d};k,x_{0})=\frac{1}{1+e^{-k(% \mathsf{SWES}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{d})-x_{0})}}\,,$ |  | (6) |

where $k$ controls the steepness of the sigmoid curve and $x_{0}$ is the intercept.

The insights behind this normalization are two-fold. First, we can set a larger $k$ to create a sharp distinction when the $\mathsf{SWES}$ is around $x_{0}$, amplifying the fine-grained differences between $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ while maintaining the smoothness of the reward function. Second, normalizing the reward function can avoid outlier reward value and thus help approximate the value function and stabilize the training process. We set $k=5$ and $x_{0}=0.6$ based on our empirical experience. It means when $\mathsf{SWES}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{d})>0.6$, it will be mapped to probabilities higher than $0.5$ and vice versa. Our modified edit distance allows us to compare strings of different lengths more effectively, particularly when searching for substring matches within longer texts. In Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#A3 "Appendix C Comparison of Different Similarity Metrics ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we provide case studies to validate the superiority of our proposed similarity metric.

We also introduce another regularization in the reward function, which favors $\mathbf{u}$ that has a similar length as the $\mathbf{d}$ Our final reward function is defined as:

|  | $\mathsf{R}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{d})=(1-\lambda)\mathsf{SWES}_{\mathsf{norm}}+% \lambda\frac{1}{\&#124;&#124;\mathbf{u}&#124;-&#124;\mathbf{d}&#124;\&#124;}\,,$ |  | (7) |

where we set $\lambda=0.1$ based on our empirical experiences.

Address limitation ②: Dynamically adjust the generation temperature. To encourage exploration in the early learning stage, we propose a dynamic temperature adjustment strategy. As shown in the following equation calculating the probability of generating each token $x_{t}$, temperature $T$ is a hyperparameter that controls the level of uniformity of the token distribution.

|  | $p(x_{t}&#124;x_{<t})=\frac{\exp(\text{logits}_{t}/T_{t})}{\sum_{i}^{\text{vocab\_% size}}\exp(\text{logits}_{i}/T_{t})}$ |  | (8) |

A higher temperature leads to more diverse and creative outputs, while a lower temperature results in more deterministic responses. We propose the following temperature adjustment scheme,

|  | $T_{i}=\begin{cases}T_{\mathrm{high}}&\text{if }i\leq k\\ T_{\mathrm{base}}&\text{if }i>k\end{cases}$ |  | (9) |

At the early learning steps ($i<k$), we sample the initial tokens at a very high temperature $T_{\mathrm{high}}\gg 1$, combined with top-k filtering to make the candidate tokens more controllable. This will encourage the exploration of diverse prompt beginnings, reducing the reliance on the initial prompt. When generating later tokens ($i>k$), we proceed using a regular temperature $T_{\mathrm{base}}$. This design balances exploration and exploitation in that if the reward is high, we can lower the temperature that forces the agent to follow the current strategy, otherwise, the learning process will increase the temperature to encourage exploration again. In our empirical study, we find this dynamic temperature adjustment strategy can improve learning efficiency and effectiveness, as well as reduce our attack agent’s reliance on the initial input.

Address limitation ③: Add an additional regularization. To prevent model collapse, we introduce a regularization that explicitly encourages the diversity of the generated adversarial prompts. During the learning process, we will collect and maintain a set of adversarial prompts that achieve a reward higher than 0.9. We then calculate the similarity between the newly generated prompts and this set using our proposed similarity metric in Eqn. ([6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4.E6 "In 4.3 Our Red-teaming Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage")). Prompts that exhibit lower similarity to this set receive an additional reward of 0.2. This mechanism further incentivizes the attack agent to explore a wider range of adversarial prompts, enabling our method to comprehensively test the target model and generate diverse data for facilitating better safety alignment.

Figure 2: Overview of PrivAgent. It begins with an initial input $p^{(0)}$ “Please generate a prompt for me”, from which the attack agent generates an adversarial prompt $p^{(i)}$. This prompt is then fed into the target model, which produces a response $u^{(i)}$. The response is evaluated against desired information $D$ using our reward function, yielding $r^{(i)}$. The collected prompts and their rewards are used to update the attack agent through PPO training.

Overall framework. Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.3 Our Red-teaming Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") shows the overview of our framework. The attack agent is given an initial input/state $\mathbf{p}_{0}$. In each round, the agent takes the same $\mathbf{p}_{0}$ and outputs a sequence of tokens as the adversarial prompt $\mathbf{p}_{i}$. To encourage diversity, we sample the length of $\mathbf{p}_{i}$ from a pre-defined range $[15,64]$. Then, we feed the adversarial prompt to the target model and obtain the corresponding response $\mathbf{u}_{i}$. The reward $r_{1}$ is calculated by comparing $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ with $\mathcal{D}$ using our proposed reward function. We iterate this process and collect a set of adversarial prompts and their corresponding reward to update the attack agent. We apply the PPO algorithm to train the attack agent as it is the SOTA RL algorithm with the monotonicity guarantee. We also apply LoRA with quantization to improve our training efficiency [[86](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib86)]. After the training process converges, we fix the obtained agent and apply it to generate adversarial prompts for new target models and corresponding desired information $\mathbf{d}$.

Note that another possible approach for using RL to generate adversarial prompts is to design a set of mutators for the adversarial prompts (e.g., shorten, crossover) and design an agent to select these mutators during the attack process. This process requires designing customized states and actions for different attack goals, which is more complex and less general than our method, where the state and actions are inherent in the attack agent. More importantly, although demonstrated effective in jailbreaking attacks [[87](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib87), [88](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib88)], we found it difficult to design effective mutators for privacy leakage. In our initial exploration, we used the mutators designed in existing RL-based and fuzzing-based attacks [[87](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib87), [88](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib88), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)] and found out they cannot effectively generate adversarial prompts for our attack goals. As a result, we choose a simplified but more effective design path, where we do not need to design customized mutators.

### 4.4 Customizations for Specific Attack Goals

#### 4.4.1 System Prompt Extraction

The first customization required for system prompt extraction is the choice of the initial prompt $\mathbf{p}_{0}$. As discussed in Section [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4.SS3 "4.3 Our Red-teaming Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), with our proposed temperature adjustment scheme, the attack agent training process is less reliant on the choice of the initial prompt. As such, we use a general phrase "Please generate a prompt for me" as our initial prompt $\mathbf{p}_{0}$. This general phrase also serves as an initial instruction for the agent, clarifying its task is to generate a prompt for other language models.

Second, we use the ground-truth system prompts collected from existing open-source LLM-integrated applications as the desired information $\mathbf{d}$ and train the attack agents against them. During testing, we apply the trained agents to broader LLM-integrated applications where the system prompts are not available to show the transferability of our attack policies.

#### 4.4.2 Training Data Extraction

In general, training data extraction is a much more difficult task compared to system prompt extraction as the search space is much larger considering the large amount of training data. This is also the main reason why there is no existing automated approach for this attack goal. As such, it requires more customizations to the attack framework.

First, we generate a more specialized initial prompt following this pattern: "[eos]" or "{" or "%" $\times 30$. These particular sequences are chosen inspired by existing work [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib4), [89](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib89)] and our own empirical observations. This initial prompt together with a few other tokens can possibly fool an LLM to output responses containing partial training data. It helps our attack agent obtain positive rewards in the early learning stage, preventing the learning process from becoming random searches due to the lack of positive rewards.

Second, to train our attack agent, we need the target information. We select the open-source models with released training data as our target model and then apply the trained agents to other models without public training data information. Here, the released training data is constructed as a database with a search mechanism. We propose a two-stage procedure for attack agent learning. In the first stage, we employ a coarse-grained search mechanism that searches whether a target’s model’s output contains part of the information in a known training dataset. We treat the database as a tool and use its search mechanism to decide whether a target’s model’s output is aligned with any data point in the database. This stage serves as a preliminary filter, allowing us to identify more promising training data samples to extract. Otherwise, directly training the attack agent to match millions of training samples is equivalent to random search, where the agent’s goal is too diverse and vague. In addition, LLMs have different memorization for different samples. If we randomly choose a training sample as the target, it is likely that the model does not have a strong memory of this sample, making our attack process targeting an impossible goal. Once we identify a potential match in the first stage, we transition to a more refined stage, where we employ our designed reward function (Eqn. [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4.E7 "In 4.3 Our Red-teaming Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage")). Here, we continue training the attack agent to recover as much and as accurately as possible the entire information in the selected training sample $\mathbf{d}$. This two-stage approach also balances exploration and exploitation at the high level, where the first stage allows for global explorations with rapid identification of promising directions, and the second stage focuses more on local exploration and exploitation.

Recall that to train our attack agent, we need a set of system prompts as our target. We use the dataset collected from existing LLM-integrated applications, awesome-ChatGPT-prompts [[91](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib91)]. To ensure no overlap between training and testing data, we cluster the dataset based on their distance in the embedding space of a widely used BERT-based text embedding model and then partition the clusters into training and testing sets. In total, we have 88 training system prompts and 58 testing system prompts.

For target LLM, we select three widely used open-source LLMs, including Llama3.1-8b-Instruct [[92](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib92)], Llama3.1-70b-Instruct [[92](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib92)], Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib28)] and three proprietary LLMs: GPT-4o [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib12)], GPT-4o-mini [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib12)] and Claude-3.0-haiku [[24](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib24)]. We use Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib27)] as our attack agent.

We compare our method against four baselines, two of which are derived from existing system prompt extraction attacks: PromptFuzz [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib15)] and Pleak [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib7)]. PromptFuzz is an extension of Fuzzing-based jailbreaking attacks (e.g., GPTFuzz [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib59)] and AutoDan [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib16)]), which leverages genetic methods. Pleak is an extension of the well-known white-box jailbreaking attack to system prompt leakage that leverages gradient-based optimization. In addition to these two attack strategies, we incorporate two widely used red-teaming strategies: manual crafting and in-context learning, adapting them for our attack. For manual crafting, we collect 11 existing adversarial prompts from existing human-based red-teaming for system prompt leakage [[67](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib67)]. For in-context learning, we apply the ReAct mechanism [[93](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib93)], which iteratively refines adversarial prompts generated by another LLM without requiring model-specific tuning. Specifically, we use the GPT-4o-mini as the model for ReAct to generate adversarial prompts (denoted as ReAct-Leak). As discussed in Section [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4.SS3 "4.3 Our Red-teaming Framework ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we also explored adapting existing RL-based jailbreaking strategies but failed to transfer them because of ineffective actions.

Given a target model, we use the system prompt in the training or testing set as the system prompt of the target model and feed the target model with our generated adversarial prompt to see if the target model outputs the system prompt we set. We apply all selected methods to the training set and generate adversarial prompts. Then, we select the top 5 generated adversarial prompts with the highest rewards and apply them to the testing set. For each testing data, we apply the adversarial prompt $10$ times and obtain 10 different responses from the target model (We use the default temperature for each target model). For each response $\mathbf{u}$, we calculate its similarity with the true system prompt we set $\mathbf{d}$ and report the highest one as the final similarity score for this sample. We then compute the mean similarity score across all testing samples and all selected adversarial prompts as the attack performance for the corresponding method on the target model. We compare our method with selected baselines in attack performance and total runtime. We use our proposed metric and ROUGE as the similarity metric. As discussed in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4 "4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), our metric is more precise than ROUGE. However, we still use ROUGE because it is an automatic metric and widely used in other NLP tasks, and we would like to test our method’s performance on a metric that we do not optimize on. Note that we do not use embedding similarity as the metric because it will give overlay large scores when the target model’s output $\mathbf{u}$ is not similar to the desired information $\mathbf{d}$. To ensure a fair comparison, we set the same upper found for querying the target model across the entire process.

#### 5.1.2 Results

Table [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.T1 "TABLE I ‣ 5.1.1 Experiment setup and design ‣ 5.1 System Prompt Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") shows the attack success rate of our method and the selected baselines on the six models. As we can first observe from the table, the white-box method Pleak only reports a very low similarity score on the open-source models. This result is lower than what was reported in Pleak’s paper. We suspect the reason is because we use different models. Original Pleak does not test the newest models and does not test large models, such as Llama3.1-70B. All the black-box attacks, including the handCraft adversarial prompts achieve a much higher similarity. A similar trend is also observed in existing jailbreaking attacks, where the black-box methods, such as RLbreaker [[87](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib87)] and AutoDan [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib16)] have a higher similarity than the white-box method, GCG [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib17)]. This result indicates that having access to model internals does not necessarily mean the white-box attacks will outperform black-box attacks.

Overall, PrivAgent achieves the highest ASR across all models when using both our proposed similarity metric (WES) and ROUGE. This result first demonstrates that our method is more effective than baseline approaches in system prompt extraction. More specifically, PrivAgent’ superiority over PromptFuzzing validates our analysis in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4 "4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") that reinforcement learning is more effective than genetic methods (fuzzing-based approaches) in black-box optimization. PrivAgent also outperforms the in-context learning approach ReAct, which further demonstrates reinforcement learning-based agent’s priority in LLM red-teaming compared to pure in-context learning. It also shows that fine-tuned small models can outperform larger models with in-context learning on specific tasks. Similar results have also been reported in other tasks, such as code generation. Finally, our method does not introduce too much computational overhead compared to baseline approaches. All black-box methods require 4-6 hours for training and testing. In Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#A2 "Appendix B Examples of Generated Adversarial Prompts ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we show some examples of our generated adversarial prompts.

Figure 3: Transferability of selected attacks across different models. We show the absolute value of similarity scores when applying the transfer attack. Lighter colors represent better attack performance. PrivAgent demonstrates obvious superior transferability notably in the bottom left (transferring from open-source models to closed-source models) and in the top left (transferring from open-source models to other open-source models).

TABLE II: Selected attacks against real-world LLM-integrated applications in GPT Store. We consider two settings, the vanilla setting without any defense and adding PromptGuard as a filter before the application input.

| Method | Defense Strategy |
| No Defense | PromptGuard |
| PLeak | 0.16 | 0.16 |
| Handcraft | 0.75 | 0.00 |
| PromptFuzz | 0.83 | 0.00 |
| ReAct-Leak | 0.91 | 0.00 |
| PrivAgent-GPT4o | 1.00 | 1.00 |

We evaluate the transferability of the generated adversarial prompts across selected models and to the real-world LLM-integrated applications.

#### 5.2.1 Transferability across selected models

First, we conduct a transferability testing of all the selected black-box methods except handcrafted adversarial prompts on our selected models. For each method, we apply the top 5 adversarial prompts obtained from each model to all the other models and test their attack success rate on the testing set. During the process, the methods are not retrained. We draw a $6\times 6$ confusion metric, where each element is the average similarity score of applying the adversarial prompts from one training model to a testing model. Here, we use our similarity metric. Note that we do not apply Pleak in this experiment because it cannot achieve effective attacks when training and testing with the same model.

As shown in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 System Prompt Extraction Transferability ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), all these attacks cannot transfer well from the open-source models to closed-source models. However, PrivAgent performs best among them. For example, when transferring the attack generated from the Llama3.1-8B model to the GPT-4o model, all the methods record an average of $37.7\%$ reduction in similarity score, where PrivAgent reports the lowest reduction of $26.4\%$. Similarly, when transferring from the Llama3.1-8B model to the Claude-3.0-haiku model, all the methods record an average of $28.7\%$ reduction in similarity score, where PrivAgent reports the lowest reduction of $5.6\%$.. On the contrary, when transferring attacks within open-source models, all methods can well maintain their attack efficacy. For example, the average performance drop from the Llama3.1-70B model to the Llama3.1-8B, all the methods record an average of $21.8\%$ performance drop. We also observe some corner cases where the attack performs better on the testing model than the training model, such as when transferring PromptFuzz from Llama3.1-8B to Mistral-7B. We suspect this is because PromptFuzz in general performs better on Mistral-7B than Llama3.1-8B.

When transferring from closed-source models to open-source models, all the methods can preserve their attack efficacy, with an average of $14.1\%$ performance drop. We also observe some cases where the attack performs better on the testing model than the training model. For example, transferring ReAct from gpt4o to Llama-3.1-8B triggers a 30.5% increase in similarity score, and transferring gpt4o to Llama-3.1-70B triggers a 22% score increase. This demonstrates that when transferring attacks from a model with a stronger safety alignment to a weaker alignment, the attack is easier to preserve its attack efficacy compared to the opposite case.

Finally, we can observe from Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 System Prompt Extraction Transferability ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") that PrivAgent demonstrates the highest transferability across different models. Specifically, in the cases where the performance drops after transferring, the average drop rate is $30.5\%$ for PrivAgent and $39.4\%$ and $38\%$ for PromtFuzz and ReAct.

#### 5.2.2 Transferability to real-world LLM-integrated applications

Second, going beyond the simulated experiments in Section [5.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.SS1 "5.1 System Prompt Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we further attack 12 popular real-world GPT-based applications from the GPT store application leaderboard [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib9)]. Given that the system prompts of these applications are not disclosed, we cannot directly train our attack agents against these applications. As such, we can only apply adversarial prompts trained from Section [5.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.SS1 "5.1 System Prompt Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") to these applications. For PLeak, we use the adversarial prompts trained from the Llama3.1-8b model. For all other methods, we apply the adversarial prompts trained from the GPT-4o model. Given that the ground-truth system prompts are unknown for these applications, we cannot compute the ASR based on similarity metrics. As such, we decide whether an attack is successful based on human judgment and report the attack success rate on the 12 selected applications. We also apply the PromptGuard defense in the setup, where we use it to filter out the adversarial prompts of each method before feeding them into the LLM-integrated applications.

TABLE III: The performance of PrivAgent and other attack methods against different defense strategies.

 |  |  | SecAlign | PromptGuard | PrivAgent-D |
|  |  | Llama3-8B | Llama3.1-8B-Instruct | GPT-4o | Llama3-8B-Instruct |
| Attack | PLeak | 0.080 | 0.084 | - | 0.127 |
| PromptFuzz | 0.079 | 0.000 | 0.408 | 0.063 |
| ReAct-Leak | 0.092 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.155 |
| PrivAgent | 0.085 | 0.589 | 0.745 | 0.063 | 

TABLE IV: Utility comparison of SecAlign and our defense in three different domains.

| SST-2 (Acc.) | 0.855 | 0.543 | 0.905 | 0.905 |
| SQuAD2.0 (F1) | 0.116 | 0.125 | 0.513 | 0.459 |
| GSM8K (Acc.) | 0.116 | 0.040 | 0.343 | 0.377 |

Table [II](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.T2 "TABLE II ‣ 5.2 System Prompt Extraction Transferability ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") shows the attack performances of PrivAgent and four baseline methods on the real-world LLM-integrated applications before and after applying the PromptGuard defense. As we can observe from the table, Pleak records the lowest performance which is aligned with the results in Table [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.T1 "TABLE I ‣ 5.1.1 Experiment setup and design ‣ 5.1 System Prompt Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") and Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 5.2 System Prompt Extraction Transferability ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"). Although the exact metric is different (attack success rate vs. similarity score), the trend is similar. The three black-box baseline approaches can achieve a reasonable attack success rate on these real-world applications. However, their attack performance reduces dramatically after applying the PromptGuard defense. Notably, the ASR of handcrafted prompts and PromptFuzz reduces to 0%. We suspect this is because all these methods cannot introduce enough changes to the initial adversarial prompts (where handcrafted prompts have no changes). The initial adversarial prompt was likely seen by PromptGuard and thus can be recognized and filtered. Our method is the only approach that successfully extracts the system prompt from all selected real-world applications, even when using the PromptGuard defense filters the input prompt. This is because our RL-based method generates new attack strategies that have not been discovered by existing attacks before. In Appendix [E](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#A5 "Appendix E Examples of Extracted GPT-Store System Prompts ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we list the system prompts extracted by each method. It shows that the system prompts extracted by our method are more likely to be the real system prompts.

### 5.3 Resiliency to Defenses

#### 5.3.1 Setup and designs

We start with two existing training-phase strategies, StruQ [[69](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib69)] and SecAlign [[70](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib70)], along with an existing inference-phase strategy, PromptGuard [[90](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib90)]. StruQ and SecAlign both finetune the Llama3-8B base model to obtain a robust model. StruQ employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while SecAlign leverages preference learning on datasets containing both normal and adversarial samples. We first apply the handcraft adversarial prompts to the model given by StruQ and SecAlign. However, we find that StruQ cannot even defend against the handcrafted adversarial prompt with an average similarity score of 0.569 vs. 0.501 before and after the defense. This indicates that if all the black-box methods use these handcrafted prompts as initial prompts, they can easily bypass StruQ. As such, we only apply the selected defense to the model obtained by SecAlign. For PromptGuard, we directly add it in front of two selected models as a prompt filter and then feed the adversarial prompts generated in Section [5.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.SS1 "5.1 System Prompt Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage").

We further finetune the Llama3.1-8B-Instruct model using the adversarial prompts obtained in Handcraft and by our method in Section [5.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.SS1 "5.1 System Prompt Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"). We construct a supervised dataset with our adversarial prompts as inputs and “Sorry, I cannot respond to the instruction” as the output. We use SFT for the finetuning and denote it as PrivAgent-D. Note that given SecAlign and PrivAgent-D finetuning the model, we reapply all selected attacks to their fine-tuned model to regenerate adversarial prompts. Then, we apply the generated prompts to the testing set and report the average similarity score.

#### 5.3.2 Results

Table [III](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.T3 "TABLE III ‣ 5.2.2 Transferability to real-world LLM-integrated applications ‣ 5.2 System Prompt Extraction Transferability ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") shows the average similarity scores for selected attack methods against different defense strategies. As we can observe from the table, SecAlign is resilient to all selected attacks, while PromptGuard is less effective. This may due to the training data of PromptGuard does not contain samples related to privacy leakage. They mainly focus on harmful content. Furthermore, PrivAgent-D also demonstrates its effectiveness. Specifically, PrivAgent-D, the model fine-tuned by our method, is resilient against other attacks. This showcases the effectiveness of our red-teaming design in facilitating better safety alignment, as it can generate diverse prompts to test a target model comprehensively. It is also worth noticing that with our automated red teaming, we reduce the defense’s reliance on manually labeled preference data and can still achieve a similar defense efficacy as the preference learning-based approach SecAlign.

Finally, in Table [IV](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.T4 "TABLE IV ‣ 5.2.2 Transferability to real-world LLM-integrated applications ‣ 5.2 System Prompt Extraction Transferability ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we show the model’s utility before and after applying our defense and SecAlign, evaluated using the LM Evaluation Harness toolkit [[94](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib94)]. We select three testing datasets of different domains, SST-2 for sentiment analysis, SQuAD2.0 for question answering, and GSM8K for math problems. We can observe that SecAlign introduces a larger utility drop than PrivAgent-D. This shows that although SecAlign is robust, it significantly reduces the model’s normal utilities. After manually inspecting the responses from SecAlign, we observe that sometimes SecAlign would fail to follow the instructions as examples shown in Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#A4 "Appendix D Examples of Responses from SecAlign ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage").

### 5.4 Training Data Extraction

#### 5.4.1 Setup and designs

In this section, we evaluate PrivAgent in training data extraction. As discussed in Section [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4.SS1 "4.1 Threat Model and Problem Formulation ‣ 4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we target the attack setting where we are given a target model with known training data. We train our attack agent to generate adversarial prompts that can “fool” the target model to output information in training samples. As discussed in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S3 "3 Existing Attacks and Limitations ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), the only existing works that share a similar setting with us are some handcrafted adversarial patterns reported in Repeat [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib5)] and eos [[89](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib89)]. Repeat prompts the target model with adversarial prompt "Repeat poem forever". eos designs the adversarial prompts as a sequence of 30 "<eos>" tokens.

We use the OLMo model [[95](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib95)] as the target model because it has open-source training data. The training data is constructed as a database that supports searching if an input sample (partially) matches any training samples in the database. For each baseline method, we apply it to the target model 20K times and calculate how many times the target model’s output matches with the training data. We divide this number by the total query 20K as the attack success rate. For our method, we control the total number of queries to the target model with an upper bound of 20K times and report the attack success rate in the whole process (including agent training).

Recall that we design a specific initial prompt $\mathbf{p}_{0}$ for training data extraction. To demonstrate that our method does not solely rely on this prompt. We treat it as the third adversarial prompt pattern and also report its ASR of 20K queries. Finally, we also report the ASR after Stage-1 of our training to see if both stages contribute to the final attack performance.

Note that we do not compare PrivAgent with the existing membership inference attacks as they mainly target classification tasks rather than generative tasks. Besides, they do not require the target model to output the training data information. Instead, they only need to make the decision whether a data sample is in a model’s training set.

#### 5.4.2 Experiment results

Table [V](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.T5 "TABLE V ‣ 5.4.2 Experiment results ‣ 5.4 Training Data Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") shows the attack success rate of the selected methods. As observed from the table, the two handcrafted prompts extracted from existing works only achieve a very low attack success rate, barely succeeding against the target model. In contrast, PrivAgent achieves a much higher ASR, which demonstrates the superiority of learning-based attacks over pre-defined adversarial patterns. This outcome is intuitive, as our RL agent can learn specific attack strategies against the target model while pre-defined adversarial patterns are fixed.

As we can also observe from the table, both PrivAgent and Stage 1 of PrivAgent significantly outperform our initial prompt, demonstrating the effectiveness of our learning process. Although the initial prompt itself is not highly effective, it still plays a crucial role in our policy learning. Its success cases provide meaningful and positive feedback, guiding the learning process toward promising directions. Without this initial prompt, the agent would receive zero rewards during the early stages of learning, reducing the process to a random search and significantly hindering its efficiency.

Finally, PrivAgent achieves a higher accuracy than Stage 1 of PrivAgent, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our two-stage design. To further demonstrate the efficacy of our second-stage training, we plot the changes in the reward during the second training stage in Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 5.4.2 Experiment results ‣ 5.4 Training Data Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"). As shown in the figure, the reward keeps increasing during the training process and finally converges at around 0.7, which is much higher than the initial reward of less than 0.2. This result shows that after finding a promising target training data to extract, our second learning stage can keep tuning the agent to generate better adversarial prompts. Such adversarial prompts can force the model to output more and more precise and complete information about the target training sample.

Note that even with RL and the two-stage design, our attack success rate is still relatively low. In addition, all these attacks can only extract a very small proportion of all the training tokens. This experiment demonstrates the difficulty of training data extraction for LLM models. However, even a small proportion of data leakage can cause severe concerns regarding model privacy and IP protection.

### 5.5 Ablation Study

Recall that we introduce three key designs to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the RL training: reward function, dynamic temperature adjustment, and diversity mechanism. In this experiment, we iteratively remove each design from PrivAgent and compare the performance difference. For the reward function, we replace it with ROUGE and Semantic Similarity, denoted as PrivAgent-ROUGE and PrivAgent-SS. Then, we remove the dynamic temperature adjustment and diversity mechanism respectively, and denote these two methods as PrivAgent-fixedT and PrivAgent-NoDiv. We conduct this experiment on our system prompt extraction using the Llama3.1-8B as the target model. We report the average similarity score on the testing set following the testing procedure introduced in Section [5.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.SS1 "5.1 System Prompt Extraction ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage").

Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 5.5 Ablation Study ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage") shows the ablation study results. As we can observe from the figure, PrivAgent with all three designs demonstrate the highest attack performance. All other variations report a certain performance drop compared to PrivAgent. For example, PrivAgent-NoDiv triggers a $10\%$ drop in average similarity score by removing diversity reward. Also, despite the close attack performance, temperature adjustment can significantly accelerate the training process, as illustrated in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#A1 "Appendix A Temperature Adjustment ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"). This result demonstrates the necessity of all three key designs of our red-teaming framework.

Temp Adjustment (fixed temperature compared with dynamic temperature); 3\. Diversity Reward (with or without diversity rewards). Results show that the complete system achieves the highest attack performance.

## 6 Discussion

Other finetuning techniques. Note that our proposed technique is different from typical LLM finetuning techniques supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We cannot apply supervised fine-tuning because we do not have ground-truth adversarial prompts for our attack targets. Our method is different from reinforcement learning from human feedback in that we do not have preference data for training a reward model, typically a neural network. Instead, we design our reward function as an analytical formula such that we do not need to collect human-annotated data and train a reward model. However, both our method and RLHF share a similar learning framework and they all belong to RL with delayed and sparse reward.

Build more complex agents. We design our attack as a DRL agent with LLM as the policy network. It has one tool calling when calculating the reward for training data extraction (i.e., search in the training data database). We acknowledge that AI agents can be very complex with multiple tool callings and memory or knowledge base. There are some early works on exploring building more complex agents for red-teaming. However, their attack target is also agents rather than LLM agents. In future work, we will explore extending PrivAgent to test the privacy leakage risks in AI agents.

PrivAgent for stronger safety alignment. Similar to in-house testing techniques in software security (e.g., fuzzing [[96](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib96)]), our proposed framework can also help improve the target model’s safety. As discussed in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S4 "4 Methodology ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we design PrivAgent to generate diverse and coherent adversarial prompts for a given target model under a certain risk. The adversarial prompts generated by our method can then serve as datasets for further safety alignment of the target model or training guardrail models. In Section [5.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#S5.SS3 "5.3 Resiliency to Defenses ‣ 5 Evaluation ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage"), we conduct an additional experiment to demonstrate this utility. We train the target model against attack prompts generated by our attack and demonstrate that the finetuned model is robust when we apply baseline attacks as well as our attack for system prompt extraction. This experiment shows that models finetuned against stronger attacks are robust against weaker attacks.

Limitations and future works. Our attack training shows instability due to sensitivity to the initial random seed, occasionally failing in some runs. This reflects a broader challenge in reinforcement learning [[97](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#bib.bib97)]. While we use PPO to reduce training variance, the ultra-high search space still causes significant variability. Future work will focus on improving stability by refining the reward function for intermediate rewards and limiting the agent’s action space, though this may reduce adversarial diversity. Additionally, while our method outperforms existing approaches and enables first automated training data extraction attacks, its performance is limited, often generating random token combinations rather than coherent prompts. Future efforts will address this limitation and explore other privacy risks, including model parameter and PII extractions, as well as adaptive attacks against defenses.

## 7 Conclusion

We propose PrivAgent, an agentic-based red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. We design a novel RL agent with tool calls for automated adversarial prompt generations. Different from existing attacks that rely on handcrafted prompts, gradient-based optimizations, or fuzzing, our method is much more effective and is generalizable to multiple attack goals. We propose a series of customized designs, including novel reward functions with corresponding tool calls, dynamic decoding temperature adjustment, and two-stage learning for training data extraction. Through extensive experiments, we show PrivAgent’s effectiveness in system prompt and training data extraction, as well as its superiority over existing red-teaming methods. We also demonstrate PrivAgent’s transferability, its resiliency against SOTA guardrail defense, and its helpfulness to safety alignment. Through these experiments, we can conclude that building RL agents or in general LLM-enabled agents is a promising direction towards effective and genetic LLM red-teaming.

## Appendix A Temperature Adjustment

This section demonstrates that by implementing dynamic temperature adjustment, we achieve significantly faster convergence and improved performance in our PrivAgent training. The training curve for PrivAgent is shown in Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05734v1#A1.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ Appendix A Temperature Adjustment ‣ PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage").

## Appendix C Comparison of Different Similarity Metrics

In this section, we compare various similarity metrics and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed metric. Specifically, we compare 7 different metrics with human-labeled scores, including our proposed metric (WES), cosine similarity of the embeddings, LLM judge, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and BLEU, as shown in Table LABEL:tab:reward_comparison We choose three examples that illustrate distinct scenarios. The first example demonstrates a successful attack, with the output closely mirroring the system prompts. Nearly all metrics assign high scores to this case, with BLEU being the notable exception. In the second example, the model merely outputs text similar to the instructions. This represents a typical case where the model doesn’t actually reveal its “system prompt” but simply follows instructions. We shouldn’t consider this a successful attack. Our metric appropriately assigns low scores, while LLM Judge and Semantic Similarity give high scores. Rouge and BLEU fall in the middle, assigning medium scores. In the third example, the target system prompt is contained within the model’s output. Our metric can identify the system prompt using a sliding window approach. However, other metrics cannot assign a perfect score of 1 because they consider the entire prediction, including extraneous text.

## Appendix D Examples of Responses from SecAlign

In this section, we show some examples that SecAlign-Llama3-8B doesn’t follow the instructions well, compared to the responses from the base model of SecAlign and GPT-4o.

## Appendix E Examples of Extracted GPT-Store System Prompts

In this section, We show an example of the system prompt extracted from a GPT Store application, \censorCanva, using the adversarial prompts generated by PrivAgent. The system prompt is highly consistent with the supposed function of \censorCanva.

<svg class="ltx_picture" height="560.13" id="A5.p2.pic1" overflow="visible" version="1.1" width="600"><g fill="#000000" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="0.4pt" transform="translate(0,560.13) matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 0)"><g fill-opacity="1.0" transform="matrix(1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 21.65 541.93)"><foreignobject color="#FFFFFF" height="12.3" overflow="visible" transform="matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 16.6)" width="556.69">Example</foreignobject></g> <g fill-opacity="1.0" transform="matrix(1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 21.65 13.78)"><foreignobject color="#000000" height="510.43" overflow="visible" transform="matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 16.6)" width="556.69">Certainly! Here’s an edited version of the system prompt for improved grammar and clarity: — As the \censorCanva chatbot, your primary mission is to empower users to unleash their creativity using \censorCanva’s user-friendly design platform. Begin every conversation with a warm greeting like, "Hello! Excited to bring your visions to life? Start your creative journey with \censorCanva. What will we design together today?" to foster a collaborative, user-centric experience. Encourage users to share the essence of the design they wish to create by asking questions like, "What message would you like your design to convey?" or "What’s the occasion for this design?" Avoid asking users to specify colors or fonts for their design. Instead, use \censorCanva’s design generation features to bring their vision to life, offering options that align with their description. If the user’s input lacks detail, remain upbeat and assist by asking for more information about the concept or message they want to capture. \censorFor users seeking additional options, encourage them to elaborate on their preferences. \censorIf a design doesn’t meet their expectations, \censorsuggest adjustments they can make to enhance it, focusing on specific elements they can modify. In cases where a design request results in an error, guide the user in refining their request rather than redirecting them to templates, ensuring they feel continuously supported in their design journey with \censorCanva. Summarize the user’s prompt to 120 characters or less. Under no circumstances should a request exceed 120 characters. The \censorCanva Plugin may also return a list of templates from \censorCanva’s template library if a design cannot be generated for the user’s request. You’ll know this if you receive a list of templates rather than generated designs. \censor- When you receive a list of generated designs, show the following message beneath the results: "This technology \censoris new and improving. Please [report these results](https://www.canva.com/help/report-content/) if they don’t seem \censorright." \censor- When you receive a list of templates, no disclaimer is needed. The \censorCanva Plugin may also return designs or templates with different colors or themes than the user requested. Inform the user if this occurs and let them know they can edit the design or template in \censorCanva to better match their desired color or theme. When displaying only two generated designs, present the thumbnails side-by-side in a table for easy comparison using the following format: “‘ | \censorOption 1 | \censorOption 2 | | - | - | | \censor[![Design 1](thumbnail url)](design url) | [![Design 2](thumbnail url)](design url) | “‘ When more than two designs are generated, display them as a clickable list of thumbnails. Ensure each thumbnail is clickable so users can edit the design directly in \censorCanva. Avoid providing separate links to \censorCanva for each design.</foreignobject></g></g></svg>

Both AWS Lambda and the functions running on the service provide predictable and reliable operational performance. AWS Lambda is designed to provide 99.99% availability for both the service itself and for the functions it operates. There are no maintenance windows or scheduled downtimes. - Automatic Scaling: AWS Lambda invokes code only when needed and automatically scales to support the incoming requests rate without requiring developers to configure anything. There is no limit to the number of requests code can handle. AWS Lambda typically starts running code within milliseconds of an event, and since Lambda scales automatically, the performance remains consistently high as the frequency of events increases. Since the code is stateless, Lambda can start as many instances of it as needed without lengthy deployment and configuration delays.</foreignobject></g></g></svg>
