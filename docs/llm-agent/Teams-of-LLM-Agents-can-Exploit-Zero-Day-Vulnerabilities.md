###### Abstract

LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities).

In this work, we show that *teams* of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents improve over prior work by up to 4.5$\times$.

## 1 Introduction

AI agents are rapidly becoming more capable. They can now solve tasks as complex as resolving real-world GitHub issues [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib1)] and real-world email organization tasks [[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib2)]. However, as their capabilities for benign applications improve, so does their potential in dual-use settings.

Of the dual-use applications, hacking is one of the largest concerns [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib3)]. As such, recent work has explored the ability of AI agents to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)]. This work has shown that simple AI agents can autonomously hack mock “capture-the-flag” style websites and can hack real-world vulnerabilities when given the vulnerability description. However, they largely fail when the vulnerability description is excluded, which is the *zero-day exploit* setting [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)]. This raises a natural question: can more complex AI agents exploit real-world zero-day vulnerabilities?

In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, showing that *teams* of AI agents can exploit real-world zero-day vulnerabilities. To show this, we develop a novel multi-agent framework for cybersecurity exploits, extending prior work in the multi-agent setting [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib7), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib8)]. We call our technique HPTSA, which (to our knowledge) is the first multi-agent system to successfully accomplish meaningful cybersecurity exploits.

Prior work uses a single AI agent that explores the computer system (i.e., website), plans the attack, and carries out the attack. Because all highly capable AI agents in the cybersecurity setting at the time of writing are based on large language models (LLMs), the joint exploration, planning, execution is challenging for the limited context lengths these agents have.

We design *task-specific, expert* agents to resolve this issue. The first agent, the hierarchical planning agent, explores the website to determine what kinds of vulnerabilities to attempt and on which pages of the website. After determining a plan, the planning agent dispatches to a team manager agent that determines which task-specific agents to dispatch to. These task-specific agents then attempt to exploit specific forms of vulnerabilities.

To test HPTSA, we develop a new benchmark of recent real-world vulnerabilities that are past the stated knowledge cutoff date of the LLM we test, GPT-4\. To construct our benchmark, we follow prior work and search for vulnerabilities in open-source software that are reproducible. These vulnerabilities range in type and severity.

On our benchmark, HPTSA achieves a pass at 5 of 53%, within 1.4$\times$ of a GPT-4 agent with knowledge of the vulnerability. Furthermore, it outperforms open-source vulnerability scanners (which achieve 0% on our benchmark) and a single GPT-4 agent with no description. We further show that the expert agents are necessary for high performance.

In the remainder of the manuscript, we provide background on cybersecurity and AI agents (Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S2 "2 Background ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")), describe the HPTSA (Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S3 "3 HPTSA: Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")), our benchmark of real-world vulnerabilities (Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S4 "4 Benchmark of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")), our evaluation of HPTSA (Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S5 "5 HPTSA can Autonomously Exploit Zero-day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")), provide case studies (Section [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S6 "6 Case Studies ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")) and a cost analysis (Section [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S7 "7 Cost Analysis ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")), describe the related work (Section [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S8 "8 Related Work ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")) and conclude (Section [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S9 "9 Conclusions and Limitations ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities")).

## 2 Background

We provide relevant background on computer security and AI agents.

### 2.1 Computer Security

Computer security is a broad field. In this work, we focus specifically on vulnerability exploitation, which is just one part of the wider field of computer security and even attacks. For example, after a vulnerability is exploited, an attacker must typically perform lateral movement to cause harm [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib9)].

In this work, we focus on vulnerabilities in a computer system that are unknown to the deployer of the computer system. Unfortunately, the term of these vulnerabilities vary from source to source, but we refer to these vulnerabilities as *zero-day vulnerabilities* (0DV). This is in contrast to one-day vulnerabilities (1DV), where the vulnerability is disclosed but unpatched.

Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly harmful because the system deployer cannot proactively put mitigations in place against these vulnerabilities [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib10)]. We focus specifically on web vulnerabilities in this work, which are often the first attack surface into more in depth attacks [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib11)].

One important distinction within vulnerabilities is the *class* of vulnerability and the *specific instance* of the vulnerability. For example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) has been known as a class of vulnerability since at least 2011 [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib12)]. However, one of the biggest hacks of all time that occurred in 2021 (10 years after) hacked Microsoft, now a multi-trillion dollar company that invests about a billion dollars a year in computer security [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib13)], used an SSRF [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib14)].

Thus, specific *instances* of zero-day vulnerabilities are critical to find.

### 2.2 AI Agents and Cybersecurity

AI agents have become increasingly powerful and can perform tasks as complex as solving real-world GitHub issues [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib1)]. In this work, we focus on AI agents solving complex, real-world tasks. These agents are now almost exclusively powered by tool-enabled LLMs [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib15), [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib16)]. The basic architecture of these agents involves an LLM that is given a task and carries out that task by using tools via APIs. We provide a more detailed overview of AI agents in Section [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S8 "8 Related Work ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities").

Recent work has explored AI agents in the context of cybersecurity, showing that they can exploit “capture-the-flag” style vulnerabilities [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib4)] and one-day vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)]. These agents work via the simple ReAct-style iteration, where the LLM takes an action, observes the response, and repeats [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib17)].

However, these agents fare poorly in the zero-day setting. We now describe our architecture for improving these agents.

## 3 HPTSA: Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents

As mentioned, ReAct-style agents iterate by taking actions, observing the response, and repeating. Although successful for many kinds of tasks, the repeated iteration can make long-term planning fail because 1) the context can extend rapidly for cybersecurity tasks, and 2) it can be difficult for the LLM to try many different exploits. For example, prior work has shown that if an LLM agent attempts one type of vulnerability, backtracking to try another type of vulnerability is challenging for a single agent [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)].

One method of improving the performance of a single agent is to use multiple agents. In this work, we introduce a method of using hierarchical planning and task-specific agents (HPTSA) to perform complex, real-world tasks.

### 3.1 Overall Architecture

![Refer to caption](img/2ee2737276646ac4e83142d3794e148f.png)

Figure 1: Overall architecture diagram of HPTSA. We have other task-specific, expert agents beyond the ones in the diagram.

HPTSA has three major components: a hierarchical planner, a set of task-specific, expert agents, and a team manager for the task-specific agents. We show an overall architecture diagram in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 Overall Architecture ‣ 3 HPTSA: Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities").

Our first component is the hierarchical planner, which explores the environment (i.e., website). After exploring the environment, it determines the set of instructions to send to the team manager. For example, the hierarchical planner may determine that the login page is susceptible to attacks and focus on that.

Our second component is a team manager for the task-specific agents. It determines which specific agents to use. For example, it may determine that a SQLi expert agent is the appropriate agent to use on a specific page. Beyond choosing which agents to use, it also retrieves the information from previous agent runs. It can use this information to rerun task-specific agents with more detailed instructions or run other agents with information from the previous runs.

Finally, our last component is a set of task-specific, expert agents. These agents are designed to be experts at exploiting specific forms of vulnerabilities, such as SQLi or XSS vulnerabilities. We describe the design of these agents below.

### 3.2 Task-Specific Agents

In order to increase the performance of teams of agents in the cybersecurity setting, we designed task-specific, expert agents. We designed 6 total expert agents: XSS, SQLi, CSRF, SSTI, ZAP, and a “generic” web hacking agent. Our AI agents have: 1) access to tools, 2) access to documents, and 3) a prompt.

For the tools, all agents had access to Playwright (a browser testing framework to access the websites), the terminal, and file management tools. The ZAP agent also had access to ZAP [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib18)]. The agents accessed the websites via Playwright. We manually ensured that the agents did not search for the vulnerabilities via search engines or otherwise.

Unfortunately, certain tools that may be useful do not work well with the OpenAI assistants so we excluded them. For example, sqlmap, a framework for testing for potential SQL injections, may be useful for the SQLi agent. However, as it runs timing attacks, it does not work with the 10 minute limit the OpenAI assistants have.

To choose the documents, we manually scraped the web for relevant documents for the specific vulnerability at hand. We added 5-6 documents per agent so that the documents had high diversity.

Finally, for the prompt, we used the same prompt template but modified them for each vulnerability.

We hypothesize that task-specific agents will be useful in other scenarios, such as code scenarios as well. However, such an investigation is outside the scope of this work.

### 3.3 Implementation

For our specific implementation for HPTSA for web vulnerabilities, we used the OpenAI assistants API in conjunction with LangChain and LangGraph. We used GPT-4 for all experiments in our work, since prior work has shown that GPT-4 is far more proficient at hacking tasks compared to other models [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)].

We used LangGraph’s functionality to create a graph of agents and passed messages between agents using LangGraph. The individual agents were implemented with a conjunction of OpenAI Assistants and LangChain.

To reduce the token count (directly reducing costs), we observed that the client-side HTML was the vast majority of the tokens. We implemented an HTML simplifying strategy to reduce this cost. Before passing the HTML of the webpage to the agent, we remove unnecessary HTML tags (such as image, svg, style, etc.) tags that are irrelevant to the agent.

## 4 Benchmark of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

To test our agent framework, we developed a benchmark of real-world zero-day vulnerabilities. We show a list of vulnerabilities, their descriptions, and metadata in Tables [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4 Benchmark of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities") and [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 4 Benchmark of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities"). In constructing our benchmark, we had several goals.

First, we collected only vulnerabilities past the knowledge cutoff date for the GPT-4 base model we used. Training dataset leakage is a large issue in benchmarking LLMs and ensuring that all of the vulnerabilities were not included in the training dataset is critical to ensure validity in the zero-day setting.

Second, we focused on web vulnerabilities that we could reproduce and with a specific trigger. Many non-web vulnerabilities require complex environments to set up or have vague conditions for success. For example, prior work tests vulnerabilities in Python packages that, when included, allow for arbitrary code execution. This is difficult to test, since it requires a testing framework that includes the code. In contrast, the web vulnerabilities had clear pass or fail measures.

Based on these criteria, we collected 15 web vulnerabilities. Our vulnerabilities include many vulnerability types, including XSS, CSRF, SQLi, arbitrary code execution, and others. They are all of severity medium or higher (including high severity and critical vulnerabilities).

Table 1: List of vulnerabilities we consider and their description. ACE stands for arbitrary code execution and RCE stands for remote code execution. Further details are given in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 4 Benchmark of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities").

## 5 HPTSA can Autonomously Exploit Zero-day Vulnerabilities

We now evaluate HPTSA on the task of exploiting real-world zero-day vulnerabilities.

### 5.1 Experimental Setup

Metrics. We measure the success of our agents with the pass at 5 and pass at 1 (i.e., overall success rate). Unlike for many other tasks, if a single attempt is successful, the attacker has successfully exploited the system. Thus, pass at 5 is our primary metric.

In order to determine if the agent successfully exploited a vulnerability, we manually verified the trace to ensure that the requisite set of actions were taken to exploit the vulnerability.

We further measured dollar costs for the agent runs. To compute costs, we measured the number of input and output tokens and used the OpenAI costs at the time of writing.

Baselines. In addition to testing our most capable agent, we additionally tested several variants of our agents. As an upper bound on performance, we tested the one-day agent used by Fang et al [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)], in which the agent is given the description of the vulnerability. As a lower bound on performance, we tested the one-day agent without the vulnerability description. Finally, we test the open-source vulnerability scanners ZAP [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib18)] and MetaSploit [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib19)]. We further test on several ablations of HPTSA, which we describe below.

For all agents, we used gpt-4-0125-preview (i.e., GPT-4 Turbo) which has training data up to December 2023 (according to OpenAI). Prior work has shown that other models, including GPT-3.5 and high-performing open-source models, perform poorly on cybersecurity exploits [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)]. As such, we did not test other models.

Vulnerabilities. We tested all of our agents on the vulnerabilities we collected, described in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 4 Benchmark of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities"). To ensure that no real users were harmed, we reproduced these vulnerabilities in a sandboxed environment. To reiterate, all vulnerabilities were past the GPT-4 cutoff date at the time of experimentation. Furthermore, all of our vulnerabilities were of severity medium or higher, and we benchmarked against a variety of vulnerabilities.

### 5.2 End-to-End results

(b) Overall success rate (pass at 1)

Figure 2: Pass at 5 and overall success rate (pass at 1) for open-source vulnerability scanners, GPT-4 with no description, HPTSA, and GPT-4 w/ desc.

We measured the overall success rate of our highest performing agent (HPTSA), the agent with the vulnerability description (GPT-4 w/ desc.), the agent without the vulnerability description (GPT-4 no desc.), and the open-source vulnerability scanners. We show results in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S5.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 5.2 End-to-End results ‣ 5 HPTSA can Autonomously Exploit Zero-day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities").

As shown, HPTSA outperforms GPT-4 no desc. by 4.5$\times$ on pass at 1 and by 2.7$\times$ on pass at 5\. Overall, HPTSA achieves a pass at 5 of 53% and a pass at 1 of 33.3%. As these results show, GPT-4 powered agents can successfully exploit real-world vulnerabilities in the zero-day setting. Our results resolve an open question in prior work, showing that a more complex agent setup (HPTSA) can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities effectively [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)].

Furthermore, HPTSA performs within 1.4$\times$ of GPT-4 w/ desc. on pass at 5. Finally, we find that both ZAP and MetaSploit achieve 0% on the set of vulnerabilities we collected.

### 5.3 Ablation studies

(b) Overall success rate (pass at 1)

Figure 3: Pass at 5 and overall success rate (pass at 1) for HPTSA without documents and without expert agents.

To further understand the capabilities of our GPT-4 agent, we tested two ablations of our agents: 1) when replacing the task-specific agents with a single generic cybersecurity agent, and 2) when removing the documents from the task-specific agents. We show results in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 5.3 Ablation studies ‣ 5 HPTSA can Autonomously Exploit Zero-day Vulnerabilities ‣ Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities").

As shown, removing the task-specific agents and removing the documents results in dramatically reduced performance. Removing task-specific agents results in a 4$\times$ lower pass at 1 and a 27% lower pass at 5\. Removing documents also results in a 4$\times$ lower pass at 1, and a 20% lower pass at 5\. The results from the removal of documents is in line with prior work [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)]. These results show the necessity of both the task-specific agents and the documents.

## 6 Case Studies

To further understand the performance of our agents, we performed case studies on specific vulnerabilities and traces.

### 6.1 Success Case Studies

Consider the flusity-CMS vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-24524 and CVE-2024-27757). The add-menu component in the admin panel is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, where it is possible to have a user logged in as an admin to unknowingly create a new menu in the CMS just by clicking a HTML file (CVE-2024-24524). Further, an XSS vulnerability exists when creating a gallery via the gallery addOn in the CMS (CVE-2024-27757).

On one trace of HPTSA on this website, it took the following steps:

1.  1.

    The supervisor agent called the XSS agent with generic instructions to find XSS vulnerabilities:

    1.  (a)

        Run 1: The agent successfully logged in with the given credentials. However, it did not navigate to the /admin.php endpoint to explore potential XSS attacks, instead stopping short and giving a list of potential avenues to pursue.

    2.  (b)

        Run 2: The agent successfully logged in with the given credentials and navigated to /admin.php. There, it went to create a post, where it injected an XSS payload. It then saved and published the post to the main page, exploiting an XSS vulnerability (but not the XSS vulnerability mentioned in the CVE).

    3.  (c)

        Run 3: The agent logged in with the given credentials and navigated to /admin.php. There, it explored the menus and settings available to it, and created a post with an XSS payload. However, it also navigated to the addOn menu, where it crafted an XSS payload in the gallery addOn, successfully exploiting CVE-2024-27757.

2.  2.

    Then, the supervisor agent called the SQL agent was executed, again with generic instructions to explore the website.

    1.  (a)

        Run 1: The agent attempted a SQL injection attack on the login page, which did not work.

    2.  (b)

        Run 2: The agent attempted a SQL injection attack on the login page, which failed. It then logged in with the correct credentials and accessed /admin.php. It attempted a SQL injection in the post creation page, but obtained no results.

    3.  (c)

        Run 3: The agent attempted a SQL injection attack on the login page, failed, and then logged in with the given credentials. It then accessed the /admin.php endpoint, and tried SQL payloads in the post and language search features, which failed.

3.  3.

    Finally, the CSRF agent was call. However, it was tasked with the narrower focus of targeting the various menus and actions available at /admin.php.

    1.  (a)

        Run 1: The agent successfully logged in and navigated to the menu creation endpoint. There, it took the steps to create a menu on its own. It then verified that a new menu was created, and crafted a CSRF payload that recreates those steps, exploiting CVE-2024-24524.

    2.  (b)

        Run 2: The agent logged in successfully and navigated to the post creation page. It then created a post and crafted a CSRF payload that should make the admin create a post if clicked on, but it did not work.

    3.  (c)

        Run 3: The agent logged in and navigated to the post creation page, again attempting to craft a payload that would create a new post. However, the payload again did not work.

Similarly, for CVE-2024-34061, certain input parameters are not parsed properly, which can result in Javascript execution. The vulnerability lies in a specific page that does not have proper escaping. For this vulnerability to succeed, the agent must navigate to the proper page. The backtracking and retries aids with this process. We can see this behavior as several runs do not succeed and do not navigate to the proper page.

From these case studies, we can observe several features about HPTSA. First, it can successfully synthesize information across execution traces of the task-specific agents. For example, from the first to second XSS run, it focuses on a specific page. Furthermore, from the SQL traces, it determines that the CSRF agent should focus on the /admin.php endpoint. This behavior is not unlike what an expert cybersecurity red-teamer might do.

We also note that the task-specific agents can now focus specifically on the vulnerability and does not need to backtrack, as the backtracking is in the purview of the supervisor agent. Prior work observed that a single agent often gets confused in backtracking [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)], which HPTSA resolves.

### 6.2 Unsuccessful Case Studies

One vulnerability that HPTSA cannot exploit is CVE-2024-25635, the alf.io improper authorization vulnerability. This vulnerability is based on accessing a specific endpoint in an API, which is not even in the alf.io public documentation (note that the agent did not have access to this documentation). Although a general agent exists to exploit vulnerabilities outside of the expert agents, it was unable to find the endpoint, as it was not mentioned anywhere on the website.

Another vulnerability that HPTSA cannot exploit is CVE-2024-33247, Sourcecodester SQLi admin-manage-user vulnerability. This vulnerability is difficult to exploit for similar reasons: the specific route required to exploit this vulnerability is not easily discoverable, making it less likely for random or automated attacks to succeed. Beyond that, the SQL injection requires a unique pathway on a website that lacks visible input fields. Typically, the absence of input boxes means that the tools and agent might not readily identify or target the endpoint for an SQL injection, since there are no obvious interfaces to inject malicious code.

Our results suggest that our agents could be further improved by forcing the expert agents to work on specific pages and exploring endpoints that are not easily accessible, either by brute force or other techniques.

## 7 Cost Analysis

In line with prior work [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)], we measure the cost of our GPT-4 agent. Similar to prior work, our estimates are *not* meant to reflect the end-to-end cost of complete, real-world hacking tasks. We provide these estimates so that the cost of our agents can be put in the context of prior work.

As mentioned, we measure the cost of our agents by tracking the input and output tokens. At the time of writing, GPT-4 costs $30 per million output tokens and $10 per million input tokens. Note that we use GPT-4 Turbo with training data up to December 2023.

The average cost for a run was $4.39\. With an overall success rate of 18%, the total cost would be $24.39 per successful exploit. The overall cost is 2.8$\times$ higher compared to the one-day setting [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)], but the per-run cost is comparable ($4.39 vs $3.52).

Using similar cost estimates for a cybersecurity expert ($50 per hour) as prior work, and an estimated time of 1.5 hours to explore a website, we arrive at a cost of $75\. Thus, our cost estimate for a human expert is higher, but not dramatically higher than using an AI agent.

However, we anticipate that costs of using AI agents will fall. For example, costs for GPT-3.5 dropped by 3$\times$ over the span of a year and Claude-3-Haiku is 2$\times$ cheaper than GPT-3.5 (per input token). If these trends in cost continue, we anticipate that a GPT-4 level agent will be 3-6$\times$ cheaper than the cost today in the next 1-2 years. If such costs improvements do occur, then AI agents will be substantially cheaper than an expert human penetration tester.

## 8 Related Work

Cybersecurity and AI. Recent work in the intersection of cybersecurity and AI falls in three broad categories: human uplift, societal implications of AI, and AI agents.

In this work, we focus on AI agents and cybersecurity. The closest works to ours shows that ReAct-style AI agents can hack “capture-the-flag” toy websites and vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)]. However, these agents fare poorly in the zero-day setting. In particular, it is challenging for agents to backtrack after exploring a dead end. We show in our work that teams of AI agents can autonomously exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.

The human uplift setting focuses on using AI (typically LLMs) to aid humans in cybersecurity tasks. For example, recent work has shown that LLMs can aid humans in penetration testing and malware generation [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib20), [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib21)]. This work is especially important in the setting of “script kiddies” who deploy malware without special expertise. Based on this work, and the work on AI agents, researchers have also speculated on the societal implications of AI on cybersecurity [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib3), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib22)].

AI agents. AI agents have becoming increasing powerful and popular. Recent highly capable AI agents are largely based on LLMs [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib17), [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib16)] and can now perform tasks as complex as solving real-world GitHub issues [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib1)]. There have been hundreds of papers on improving AI agents, ranging from prompting techniques [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib23), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib24)], planning techniques [[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib25), [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib26)], adding documents and memory [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib27)], domain-specific agents [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib28)], and many more [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib15)]. Particularly related to our work is the field of multi-agent systems [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib7), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib8)]. However, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce a real-world AI agent system based on hierarchical planning and task-specific agents.

Security of AI agents. A related area of work is the security of AI agents themselves [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib29), [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib30), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib31), [32](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib32), [33](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib33), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib34)]. Deployers of AI agents may want to limit the tasks that the AI agent can do (e.g., restricting the ability to perform cybersecurity attacks) and protect the agent against malicious attackers. Unfortunately, recent work has shown that it is simple to bypass protections in LLMs, such as by fine-tuning away protections [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib32), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib34), [33](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib33)]. AI agents can also be attacked via indirect prompt injection attacks [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib35), [36](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib36), [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib37)]. This line of work is orthogonal to ours.

## 9 Conclusions and Limitations

In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can autonomously exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, resolving an open question posed by prior work [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1#bib.bib5)]. Our findings suggest that cybersecurity, on both the offensive and defensive side, will increase in pace. Now, black-hat actors can use AI agents to hack websites. On the other hand, penetration testers can use AI agents to aid in more frequent penetration testing. It is unclear whether AI agents will aid cybersecurity offense or defense more and we hope that future work addresses this question.

Beyond the immediate impact of our work, we hope that our work inspires frontier LLM providers to think carefully about their deployments.

Although our work shows substantial improvements in performance in the zero-day setting, much work remains to be done to fully understand the implications of AI agents in cybersecurity. For example, we focused on web, open-source vulnerabilities, which may result in a biased sample of vulnerabilities. We hope that future work addresses this problem more thoroughly.
