###### Abstract

Post-training is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. Inspired by the recent success of using LLMs to simulate human society, we leverage multi-agent simulation to automatically generate diverse text-based scenarios, capturing a wide range of real-world human needs. We propose MATRIX, a multi-agent simulator that creates realistic and scalable scenarios. Leveraging these outputs, we introduce a novel scenario-driven instruction generator MATRIX-Gen for controllable and highly realistic data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively generates both general and domain-specific data. Notably, on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, Llama-3-8B-Base, post-trained on datasets synthesized by MATRIX-Gen with just 20K instruction-response pairs, outperforms Meta’s Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, which was trained on over 10M pairs; see our project at [https://github.com/ShuoTang123/MATRIX-Gen](https://github.com/ShuoTang123/MATRIX-Gen/).

## 1 Introduction

Post-training is a crucial process that enables large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions and enhance specific capabilities like coding and mathematics (Achiam et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib1); Dubey et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib14)). The effectiveness of post-training heavily relies on instruction data that capture the real-world user requirements. However, obtaining such data in the real world poses significant challenges, including privacy concerns (Yu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib50)), data scarcity (Villalobos et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib39)), and human labor costs (Liu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib27)). Consequently, developing efficient methods to synthesize high-quality post-training data is critical for the advancement of LLMs, which motivates this work.

Current data synthesis approaches typically leverage the generative capability of aligned LLMs. For example, [Taori et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib37); [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib42); [Xu et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib46); [Xu et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib47) employ tailored prompts to guide aligned LLMs in producing new instructions based on pre-defined seed instructions. Similarly, [Xu et al.](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48) use pre-defined blank chat templates to generate synthetic instructions with aligned LLMs. While efficient, these approaches fail to explicitly incorporate real-world user requirements into the data synthesis process. Furthermore, their dependence on hand-crafted, pre-defined prompts means careful seed instruction selection and prompt engineering are required for producing high-quality data that fit specific user requirements. These limitations not only increase the risk of generating unrealistic instructions misaligned with actual user requirements but also reduce the controllability of these methods in generating specialized data.

In this work, we introduce multi-agent simulation as a novel foundation for post-training data synthesis. Inspired by recent successes in using LLMs to simulate the human society (Park et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib34); Horton, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib18); Aher et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib2)), we employ multi-agent simulation to automatically generate diverse scenarios in text, capturing a wide range of real-world human needs. For instance, in a flight delay scenario, where passenger agents interact with a customer service agent, there is a clear need for assistance in finding alternative flights or transportation options. By integrating multi-agent simulation into data synthesis, we automate the creation of diverse, contextually grounded references to reflect various real-world human requirements. The diversity and realism of these references can lead to a controllable synthesis process for highly realistic data. Following this perspective, we propose a novel post-training data synthesis framework comprising two key components: a multi-agent simulator named MATRIX and a scenario-driven instruction generator named MATRIX-Gen.

To simulate realistic and diverse scenarios, MATRIX incorporates two core components: $1000$ real-world-grounded agents and a structured communication mechanism. For creating agents that can exhibit human-like actions, we assign real-human-grounded profiles and life goals to the agents, allowing them to pursue meaningful goals while interacting with other agents. To enable efficient large-scale simulation, we design a structured communication mechanism, inspired by the homophily phenomenon in human society (McPherson et al., [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib28)), which suggests individuals tend to associate with others who share similar characteristics. In the structured communication mechanism, we group those agents with similar profiles. This grouping effectively reduces meaningless interactions among agents, enabling scalable simulations. Together, these components enable MATRIX to simulate diverse and realistic text-based scenarios.

Building on realistic and diverse scenarios generated by MATRIX, we present MATRIX-Gen, a novel scenario-driven instruction generator that enables the controllable creation of highly realistic synthetic data. MATRIX-Gen synthesizes instruction data by integrating simulated scenarios with specific user requirements, enhancing both realism and controllability in generating specialized, high-quality data. MATRIX-Gen can synthesize three types of high-quality datasets: 1) MATRIX-Gen-SFT, a supervised fine-tuning dataset with simple and diverse instructions; 2) MATRIX-Gen-DPO, a preference tuning dataset with complex, specialized instructions; and 3) domain-specific supervised fine-tuning datasets tailored for areas, such as coding and safety.

Leveraging the powerful combination of MATRIX and MATRIX-Gen, we synthesized a series of high-quality datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of our data synthesis framework, we conduct extensive experiments comparing the performance of Llama-3-8B-Base post-trained on our synthesized datasets with its performance when post-trained on various other datasets. The results are promising: our datasets excel across multiple domains, improving LLM general problem-solving ability, multi-turn conversation ability, coding accuracy, and safety level, surpassing alternatives designed for these specific tasks. Remarkably, on AlpacaEval 2 (Li et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib25)) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib23)), two LLM general problem-solving ability benchmarks, the model trained on 20K our synthetic instruction-response pairs, consistently outperforms models trained on significantly larger datasets, including Meta’s Llama-3-8B-Instruct post-trained on over 10M pairs (Dubey et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib14)).

## 2 Proposed Post-Training system

Figure 2: Overview of the proposed post-training data generation process from scenarios.

Our post-training system aims to enhance the instruction-following capability of pre-trained LLMs by leveraging synthetic training data generated by an aligned LLM, which is grounded on simulated social scenarios. The key idea is inspired by how humans ask questions in real-life scenarios. People naturally generate diverse and deep questions based on their needs and goals. Our approach bypasses seed data, using real-life scenarios to guide models in generating more informative and realistic questions, resulting in higher-quality training data. As shown in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), the framework involves three key steps: synthesizing social scenarios, generating post-training data based on scenarios, and model fine-tuning. Here the first two steps are empowered by the same aligned LLM and fine-tuning is operated on pre-trained LLMs.

Synthesizing social scenarios. Following our key idea of synthesizing realistic post-training data grounded on real-world scenarios, we propose to automatically synthesize social scenarios via multi-agent simulation, where the scenarios are defined as groups of agents and their corresponding textual actions. To ensure the realism and diversity of the simulated scenarios, we design MATRIX, a large-scale multi-agent simulator that creates an interactive environment with various agents. This simulator leverages LLM’s role-playing capability, enabling agents with varied profiles to simulate human behavior, plan, observe, and act, resulting in diverse and highly realistic social scenarios.

The workflow of social scenario synthesis includes three steps: i) given real agent data crawled from the web, the LLM is prompted to generate agent profiles and create agent-specific goals based on these profiles; ii) given agent profiles, the communication topology among agents is initialized according to the network homophily among the text embeddings of the corresponding agents’ profiles; and iii) based on this topology, agents execute their goals by generating actions and interacting with other agents within the simulator. The social scenarios are parsed from the interactions among the agents, containing diverse close-to-real human behaviors and intentions; see examples of simulated scenarios in Table [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T19 "Table 19 ‣ B.3 Simulation ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation").

These steps ensure the generated social scenarios are realistic and diverse, with agents’ actions resembling real human behavior and their interactions being informative; see more details in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S3 "3 Matrix: Large scale multi-agent simulator ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation").

Generating post-training data from scenarios. Given the simulated social scenarios, we generate post-training data under the specific user requirements. To achieve this, we propose MATRIX-Gen, a scenario-driven instruction generator that selects relevant scenarios of user requirements used for instruction generation. This approach takes real human intentions into account, making the synthesized instructions better reflect human needs and possess greater authenticity and realism. By adjusting the specific requirements of humans in the data synthesis prompt, this approach could guarantee that the synthesized data can be aligned with additional synthetic targets, which offers great controllability in generating synthesized instructions.

As shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 2 Proposed Post-Training system ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), this synthetic data generation process includes three steps: i) retrieving the most relevant simulated scenarios based on the given specific human requirements; ii) for each selected scenario, MATRIX-Gen simulates the process of human posing questions in their daily lives by intergrating each agent’s persona and action within the scenario into the instruction-synthesis prompt to generate instructions; iii) based on the instruction synthesis prompt in the previous step, directly call the aligned LLM to get the synthesized instructions and the corresponding responses; see an example of the generated instruction in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S2.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 2 Proposed Post-Training system ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation").

Table 1: The example of persona and scenario used to synthesize instructions.

Based on these steps, by controlling the synthesizing process, our post-training system could synthesize three types of datasets, including 1) the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset MATRIX-Gen-SFT, 2) the preference tuning dataset MATRIX-Gen-DPO, and 3) SFT data in special domains. For MATRIX-Gen-SFT, the instructions are generated with both simplicity and diversity. For MATRIX-Gen-DPO, the instructions are complex and specialized, with the chosen response coming from the aligned LLM, and the rejected response from the SFT model to be fine-tuned. For SFT data in special domains, we synthesize domain-specific datasets from diverse, informative scenarios by adjusting the instruction type in the synthesis prompt, such as coding, safety, or other relevant areas.

Model fine-tuning. Given the dataset MATRIX-Gen-SFT, we perform supervised fine-tuning on a pre-trained model to get a SFT model. Then, given the preference tuning dataset MATRIX-Gen-DPO, we perform standard direct preference optimization based on this SFT model. We call the final model after our post-training process as MATRIX-Tuned-Model.

The proposed post-training system integrates real human profiles and high-quality scenarios to enhance the instruction synthesis process. By incorporating human profiles, the system mimics how humans generate questions, enabling the outputs to align with human intentions. Meanwhile, high-quality scenarios provide a detailed and diverse context that allows for the generation of complex and varied instructions. This approach ensures that the synthesized instructions not only reflect human needs but also maintain a high level of diversity and complexity. This post-training system offers two key advantages: i) Realism in generated synthetic instructions and ii) Controllability in synthetic data generation.

Realism in generated synthetic instructions. Our system leverages diverse, informative social simulation scenarios and close-to-real agent actions in instruction generation process, compared to the seed-data based approaches (Xu et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib46); Wang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib42)), resulting in better alignment with real human intentions and daily needs. Conventional approaches primarily rely on LLMs to augment existing instructions (Xu et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib46)), typically by adding requirements or elaborating on the given instructions. This approach might generate instructions that are illogical or inconsistent when model lacks a sufficient understanding of the original instruction’s context. In comparison, MATRIX-Gen generates diverse scenarios as contexts that encompass a wide range of cultural, task-related, and situational requirements. By introducing these scenarios as context, the latent knowledge and capabilities of LLMs are effectively activated. This approach overcomes the challenges of directly generating complex instructions, which significantly improves the diversity and quality of the instructions.

Controllability in synthetic data generation. Our MATRIX-Gen generator can be easily controlled over specific user requirements by retrieving the most relevant scenarios from a large amount of scenario candidates for the instruction synthesis process. Unlike approaches that rely on pre-defined blank chat templates (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)), this approach allows for the generation of diverse problem categories tailored to specific needs. By adjusting the generation prompts, MATRIX-Gen can customize instructions based on task categories, complexity levels, and questioning styles. This level of control allows for more precise customization of synthetic data.

## 3 Matrix: Large scale multi-agent simulator

This section elaborates on our multi-agent simulator, MATRIX. As shown in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 3.1 Real-world-grounded Agents ‣ 3 Matrix: Large scale multi-agent simulator ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), it operates by taking a collection of agent profiles as input and generates simulated scenarios, where each scenario comprises the actions of a group of agents in text. MATRIX simulates numerous realistic and diverse scenarios with two key elements: real-world-grounded agents and structured communication.

### 3.1 Real-world-grounded Agents

Agents in our simulation possess attributes including name, personality, and life goals, alongside modules for memory and action. These agents exhibit human-like actions through two key designs: i) they are initialized using anonymized real human profiles, and ii) they are driven by goal-oriented actions, allowing them to pursue meaningful goals while interacting with other agents.

Real human profiles. To simulate human behaviors effectively, we collect real human profiles and process them through the LLM to remove or anonymize any private information, ensuring no personal identity is leaked. Each profile includes a unique anonymized name, description, and a record of past actions, all processed to protect privacy. We initialize 1,000 agents using this information, embedding their action history into memory. These agents cover a broad spectrum of real humans, representing diverse demographics, professions, and life experiences. This diversity ensures that the simulation captures a wide range of human behaviors and interactions. By leveraging large-scale real profiles, our agents behave more authentically, resulting in highly realistic and varied scenes.

Goal-oriented actions. Modeled after real-world human behaviors, we design agents’ actions to be driven by their specific life goals. For each agent, we prompt the LLM to generate life goals and a core personality based on the individual’s past actions. The life goals are then broken down into actionable steps, forming the agent’s plan. This mirrors how real humans form their identities—through accumulated experiences and actions over time. For example, a medical professor’s life goal might involve spreading scientific knowledge, with a plan that includes conducting research, publishing papers, giving lectures, and organizing educational programs. These steps guide the agent’s future actions, ensuring they actively work toward achieving their goal and exhibit purposeful actions. When new observations arise, agents react to them based on their memory and personality. In the absence of new observations, they follow their plan to pursue their goals; see Table [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T15 "Table 15 ‣ B.1 Agent ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") for goals and Table [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T16 "Table 16 ‣ B.1 Agent ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") for actions, including prompts and examples; This ensures agents remain proactive and responsive, leading to coherent and believable behavior that enhances the realism of the simulation.

Figure 3: Our MATRIX generates realistic and diverse scenarios with $1000$ real-world-grounded agents and structured communication (agent grouping, inter- and intra-group communication ).

### 3.2 Structured Communication Mechanism

To synthesize high-quality data, which requires both diversity and realism, simulations must support diverse interactions among a large number of agents to create rich and realistic scenarios. While we implement concurrent agent actions to reflect real-world interactions, a key problem arises: agents may receive an overload of irrelevant messages, causing meaningless actions that hinder the simulation’s progress and reduce realism.

To address this, we introduce a structured communication mechanism. Inspired by the homophily phenomenon in human society (McPherson et al., [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib28)), which suggests individuals tend to associate with others who share similar characteristics, we group our agents based on similar profiles. This grouping effectively reduces unnecessary connections among agents, enabling scalable simulations. For each group, we introduce a centralized modulator to manage communication both within and between groups. This design promotes more interactions among similar agents while still allowing for long-distance interactions, enriching the flow of information and enhancing realism.

Agent grouping. To facilitate large-scale simulations, we minimize unnecessary communication by organizing agents into groups based on similar social interactions. Agent profiles are transformed into text embeddings (Neelakantan et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib32)) and grouped using constrained $K$-means clustering (Bradley et al., [2000](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib7)) to ensure that agents with similar characteristics are clustered together. We set $K$ to 200 due to hardware constraints, resulting in groups of 1 to 10 agents each; see Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ B.1 Agent ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") for agent-wise similarity indicating the rich structural relationships between agents. Additionally, agent grouping introduces a range of interaction types. Interactions between two agents occur pair-wise, while larger groups facilitate more complex dynamics. This diversity of interactions further enhances the realism of the simulation.

Modulator. To manage the groups, we design the LLM-empowered modulators. Acting as a central server in each group, the modulator collects and distributes agent actions, managing both intra-group and inter-group communication. For intra-group communication, the modulator selectively delivers relevant actions to the appropriate agents within each group. By basing its decisions on agent profiles and current actions, the modulator ensures that agents only receive relevant information, maintaining purposeful interactions. For inter-group communication, each modulator maintains a memory of its group’s scenarios—each consisting of the actions of its agents. This memory captures key details of the group’s internal dynamics and helps guide decisions about sharing actions with other groups. When an action occurs, the modulator evaluates whether to share it with other groups by considering the stored memories of other modulators; see modulator prompts in Table [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T17 "Table 17 ‣ B.2 Modulator ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") This selective communication fosters complex interactions across groups, leading to richer and more diverse scenarios.

Overall, the structured communication design ensures a scalable and authentic simulation with various interaction patterns, facilitating the generation of realistic, large-scale scenarios.

### 3.3 Scenario Generation

The generation of large-scale realistic scenarios occurs through the following key stages:

Initialization. Starting with 1,000 real profiles, the LLM first anonymizes or removes any private information. It then generates goals and plans for each agent. Agents are grouped based on the text embeddings of their profiles, clustering similar agents together.

Execution. At the start of each scenario, agents in a group execute their plans to fulfill their life goals and interact with each other. The modulator collects all agents’ actions and waits until every agent has acted, thereby completing a scenario. Before the next scenario, agents from different groups exchange information via their modulators. These interactions are used in the subsequent scenario, allowing inter-group communication to influence intra-group dynamics in the next scenario.

Termination. The simulation ends when agents either stop generating actions, indicating they’ve fulfilled their life goals, or when the desired number of scenarios has been collected.

After the simulation, generated scenarios are collected from the modulators and used for post-training data synthesis; see a complete simulation example in Table [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T15 "Table 15 ‣ B.1 Agent ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") and Table [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T19 "Table 19 ‣ B.3 Simulation ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation").

### 3.4 Discussions

Rationality and advantages of MATRIX in facilitating data synthesis. MATRIX’s ability to synthesize diverse and authentic data stems from the diversity and realism of its simulated scenarios, which are built on two key foundations. First, its real-world-grounded agents are designed to emulate human behaviors, ensuring that the scenarios they generate closely resemble real-world interactions. Second, MATRIX employs a structured communication mechanism that facilitates large-scale interactions among numerous agents. This framework supports a variety of interaction forms—ranging from individual exchanges to group dynamics—resulting in a broad spectrum of scenarios. Consequently, the diverse interactions between agents produce a wide range of scenarios, leading to synthesized data that is both richly diverse and authentically reflective of real-world complexity.

Comparison with existing simulators. Recently, multi-agent simulations have gained attention for studying the social and personality attributes of LLMs. While sociological simulators (Park et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib34); Mou et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib30); Gu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib17)), designed for specific environments, can generate basic societal actions such as daily conversations or posting tweets, they suffer from constrained scenarios and simplistic actions; see examples in Table [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T18 "Table 18 ‣ B.3 Simulation ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"). In reality, human behavior is highly diverse, ranging from simple to complex, making it unrealistic to rely on these simulators for synthesizing rich and complex data. In contrast, MATRIX drives agents’ behaviors by their life goals. The large number of agents and their dynamic interactions generate a broad spectrum of scenarios, from everyday conversations to complex professional tasks, making MATRIX highly effective at producing diverse, high-quality datasets; see examples in Table [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T19 "Table 19 ‣ B.3 Simulation ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation").

Moreover, while PersonaHub (Chan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib8)) is not a simulator, it leverages the role-playing capabilities of LLMs to generate instructions based on large-scale profiles. Despite the large scale of these agent profiles, there is no interaction between agents, limiting the potential to create nuanced, complex, and contextually rich scenarios. In contrast, MATRIX synthesizes data from diverse realistic scenarios driven by realistic agent interactions. This not only results in more comprehensive synthetic data but also better reflects real-world LLM applications, where users engage with complex scenarios and pose context-specific questions to the model.

## 4 Experimental Results

In this section, we evaluate the quality of synthetic data generated by our MATRIX-Gen by using them to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs. We compare the MATRIX dataset family with baselines across instruction tuning, preference tuning, and specific domain tasks.

### 4.1 Experimental Setups

Baselines for instruction tuning. For instruction following, we compare MATRIX-Gen-SFT with six baselines, including real and synthetic datasets. Instruction tuning baselines include real datasets ShareGPT (Chiang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib10)) and WildChat (Zhao et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib51)), synthetic datasets Evol Instruct (Xu et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib46)), UltraChat (Ding et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib13)), Magpie (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)), and mixed datasets OpenHermes (Teknium, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib38)) and Tulu V2 Mix (Ivison et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib19)).

Baselines for preference tuning. For preference tuning, we compare MATRIX-Gen-DPO with four baselines, including UltraFeedback (Cui et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib12)), OpenOrca (Mukherjee et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib31)), Argilla DPO (argilla, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib3)), and Magpie-PRO-DPO (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)).

Baselines for specific domain tasks. Here we consider three specific domains, including coding, safety and multi-turn dialogue. For coding, we compare the MATRIX-Gen-Coding dataset with Code-Assistant (glaiveai, [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib16)), Code-Feedback (Zheng et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib53)), and Magicoder (Wei et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib44)). For multi-turn dialogue doamin, we compare MATRIX-Gen-MT with Magpie-MT (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)) and ShareGPT (Chiang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib11)). For safety domain, we compare the MATRIX-Gen-Safety with HH (Bai et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib6)), Beavertails (Ji et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib22)), and Safe-RLHF (Ji et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib21)).

Models. We use Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib14)) to drive the simulation. For general task, we fine-tune Llama-3-8B with SFT followed by DPO (Rafailov et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib36)), resulting in the MATRIX-Tuned Model. The initial models for coding, safety, and multi-turn tasks are Llama-3-8B-Instruct, MATRIX-Tuned Model, and Llama-3-8B, respectively. For all experiments, we use 10k samples and train for 2 epochs; see experiments on Qwen2 (Yang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib49)) in Appendix [A.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A1.SS2 "A.2 Experiments on other models ‣ Appendix A Experiments ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation").

Evaluation. For instruction-following, we use two widely recognized benchmarks: AlpacaEval 2 (Li et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib25)) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib23)). AlpacaEval 2 comprises 805 real user queries, with model responses compared against GPT-4-Turbo (1106) as the reference while Arena-Hard includes 500 challenging user queries, with model responses compared against GPT-4-0314 as the reference. In both benchmarks, GPT-4-Turbo (1106) serves as the judge to evaluate the win rate (WR) between the evaluated model and the reference. AlpacaEval 2 also employs length-controlled win rate (LC) (Dubois et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib15)) to reduce length gameability. For multi-turn dialogue, we use MT-Bench-101 (Bai et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib5)). For coding, we use HumanEval (Chen et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib9)) and MBPP (Austin et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib4)) to test code generation capabilities by measuring pass@1 rate. For safety, we select 100 harmful instructions from Safe-RLHF (Ji et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib21)) and AdvBench (Zou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib55)). We use GPT-4 to evaluate the helpful and harmless scores following (Bai et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib6)), and measure the attack success rate (ASR) to evaluate the models’ refusal of harmful instructions.

### 4.2 Evaluation of data quality in the general domain

MATRIX-Gen-SFT outperforms other SFT datasets. Here, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in synthesizing high-quality for SFT, where we compare the performance of Llama-3-8B fine-tuned by the same amount (10k) of our MATRIX-Gen-SFT and data of baselines. Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setups ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") shows that our model consistently and significantly outperforms baseline models. Specifically, in Arena-Hard, ours outperforms the state-of-the-art synthetic dataset Magpie (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)) with a $31\%$ relative improvement, and real-world dataset WildChat (Zhao et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib51)) with a $163\%$ relative improvement. These indicate the high utility of our synthetic SFT data.

MATRIX-Gen-DPO outperforms other preference datasets. Here, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in synthesizing high-quality for DPO, where we continue DPO training based on the model tuned using MATRIX-Gen-SFT. The comparison is conducted among our MATRIX-Gen-DPO and four existing preference datasets. Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setups ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") shows that our model consistently outperforms baseline models with a significant margin and even performs better than Llama-3-8B-Instruct that is officially trained by Meta (Dubey et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib14)). This suggests that our MATRIX-Gen-DPO dataset is of high-quality, which even outperforms datasets created by stronger models and expertise, for example, UltraFeedback (Cui et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib12)) uses GPT-4 for rating, Magpie-PRO-DPO (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)) uses Llama-3-70B-Instruct for generating responses, and Meta makes heavy investment in collecting data for training Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib14)).

MATRIX-Tuned-Model outperforms others, including Llama-3-8B-Instruct, with significantly less data. Here, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our complete post-training system by comparing our final model and models trained by baselines. Note that in this experiment, we use their default data amount in baselines. Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 4.1 Experimental Setups ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") shows that our model consistently and significantly outperforms baseline models with significantly fewest data samples. Specifically, compared to Llama-3-8B-Instruct trained by Meta, our model, which is trained with less than $\mathbf{0.2\%}$ data, performs $\mathbf{10\%}$ relatively better on Arena-Hard.

### 4.3 Evaluation of data quality in the specific domain

Here, we demonstrate the controllability of our MATRIX-Gen generator in generating data for domain-specific tasks, including coding, multi-turn dialog and safety.

Multi-turn dialog. We highlight the controllability of MATRIX in synthesizing multi-turn dialogue data. We compare the performance of models fine-tuned with MATRIX-Gen-MT dataset against both multi-turn SFT and single turn SFT datasets baselines, all in 10K data samples. Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 4.3 Evaluation of data quality in the specific domain ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") shows that: i) our MATRIX-Gen-MT dataset consistently outperforms the baselines across three overarching abilities; ii) multi-turn training during SFT is more efficient than single-turn training. These indicate that our framework offers high controllability for synthesizing multi-turn dialog SFT data.

Coding. We compare the performance of Llama3-8B-Instruct fine-tuned using MATRIX-Gen-Coding dataset against those SFT datasets in the coding domain or in the general domain, all in 10K data samples. Table [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.T7 "Table 7 ‣ 4.3 Evaluation of data quality in the specific domain ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") shows that: i) our MATRIX-Gen-Coding dataset consistently outperforms the baselines; ii) compared to baselines generating general-domain synthetic data (Xu et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib46); [b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)), our framework offers high controllability for synthesizing coding-specific SFT data.

Safety. We further highlight the flexibility of MATRIX in synthesizing safety data. Table [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.T7 "Table 7 ‣ 4.3 Evaluation of data quality in the specific domain ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation") compares the performance of models fine-tuned with MATRIX-Gen-Safe against other safety alignment datasets. Our findings indicate that: i) there are significant security concerns with the current synthetic training data in general domains, with a relatively high ASR in AdvBench (e.g., 82% for Magpie (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48))); ii) our MATRIX-Gen-Safe dataset consistently outperforms the baselines, which validates the high controllability of our synthetic data in safety tasks.

### 4.4 Analysis of MATRIX-Gen generated synthetic data

Effect of agent scale. The results presented in Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Analysis of MATRIX-Gen generated synthetic data ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation")(a) indicate that increasing the number of agents involved in the simulation leads to the generation of higher-quality data, which subsequently improves the model’s performance after SFT. At a scale of 1000 agents, both the AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard evaluation benchmark show higher scores, suggesting that larger-scale simulationscapture complex, multi-agent interactions similar to those in real-world human societies more effectively. This improvement can be attributed to the diverse interactions and viewpoints generated in the simulation, which enrich the data by reflecting a broader range of social dynamics.

Figure 4: Increasing scales of agents and scenarios significantly improves model performances.

Effect of scenario scale. Here, we aim to verify the realism and informativeness of the simulated scenarios generated by MATRIX. Here we verify the effectiveness of the scenarios by adjusting the number of scenarios used to generate instructions, from $10^{2}$ to $10^{4}$. The results in Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Analysis of MATRIX-Gen generated synthetic data ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation")(b) show a strong scaling effect, where increasing the number of scenarios used to generate instructions significantly improves the model’s performance.

Figure 5: The statistics of input difficulty and quality.

Effect of structured communication. We verify the effectiveness of our structured communication mechanism. Specifically, we compare the quality of simulated scenarios with different communication mechanisms, by comparing with the synthesized SFT dataset with the same generation prompt. As shown in Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 4.4 Analysis of MATRIX-Gen generated synthetic data ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), our agent-grouping-based structured communication produces the highest quality scenarios, while random communication and no communication yield lower quality results.

Quality of MATRIX-Gen generated instructions. Following Magpie (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)), We use the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model to assess the quality of instructions in MATRIX-Gen-SFT and MATRIX-Gen-DPO, categorizing them as very poor, poor, average, good, and excellent. Figure[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Analysis of MATRIX-Gen generated synthetic data ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation")-(a) shows the histograms of qualities for both datasets. We make two key observations. First, both datasets are of high quality, with no instances rated as very poor and the majority rated average or above. Second, the overall quality of MATRIX-Gen-DPO surpasses that of MATRIX-Gen-SFT, with significantly more instructions rated as good or excellent. This reflects the specialized nature of MATRIX-Gen-DPO data compared to the simpler MATRIX-Gen-SFT data.

Difficulty of MATRIX-Gen generated instructions. We use the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model to rate the quality of each instruction in MATRIX-Gen-SFT and MATRIX-Gen-DPO, categorizing them as ‘very poor’, ‘poor’, ‘average’, ‘good’, and ‘excellent’, as done in Magpie (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)). The histograms of the levels of difficulty for both datasets are presented in Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 4.4 Analysis of MATRIX-Gen generated synthetic data ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation")-(b). We observe that MATRIX-Gen-DPO contains no very easy instructions and predominantly features medium and hard instructions, highlighting its complexity. In contrast, MATRIX-Gen-SFT is skewed toward easy and medium difficulty, reflecting its focus on simpler instructions.

| LC (%) $\uparrow$ | WR (%) $\uparrow$ | SD | WR (%) $\uparrow$ |
|  | Without Communication | 6.58 | 6.77 | 0.83 | 5.9 |
|  | Random Communication | 7.99 | 8.51 | 0.86 | 6.4 |

Synthesizing alignment data. Aligning LLMs with human expectations requires high-quality data that accurately reflects human needs and intentions (Wang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib43)). Initial efforts sought to transform existing NLP benchmarks into instructions (Wang et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib41); Mishra et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib29)) or collect user-generated instructions (Chiang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib10); Zhao et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib51); Zhou et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib54)). However, Villalobos et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib39)) have raised concerns that human-generated data may not scale adequately. To address this bottleneck, synthetic data generation from LLMs has emerged as a promising alternative. Current methods typically involve back-translating from web corpora (Li et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib24)), prompting LLMs to generate new instructions from existing ones (Wang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib42); Xu et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib46)), or guiding LLMs to complete chat templates (Xu et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib48)). While they rely on predefined materials, limiting flexibility and missing real-world context, our approach generates instructions from simulated social scenarios, offering more flexibility and realism.

Multi-agent simulation. Multi-agent simulations have been utilized for tasks such as societal research (Xie et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib45)) and the evaluation of LLMs (Lin et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib26)). These simulators can generally be divided into two categories based on agent behavior: those focused purely on social interactions (Gu et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib17)), like speaking, chatting, or posting on social media, and those that support more complex agent actions ([Wang et al.,](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib40) ). While early simulators (Park et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib34); [Pang et al.,](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib33) ) typically featured only a small number of agents, recent efforts have aimed to scale up the number of agents (Mou et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib30)). However, research on large-scale scalability is still limited, and many of these simulations run for extended durations. (Qian et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib35)) In contrast, our simulator is specifically designed for synthetic data generation, supporting both complex agent actions and scalable simulations, addressing the demand for diverse, realistic, and efficient simulations.

## 6 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presents a novel framework for synthesizing post-training data based on multi-agent simulation. Our framework consists of two key components: MATRIX, a multi-agent simulator that generates realistic and diverse scenarios with scalable communications, and MATRIX-Gen, a scenario-driven instruction generator. MATRIX provides the realism and controllability needed for MATRIX-Gen to synthesize datasets for tasks such as SFT, DPO, and domain-specific applications. Experimental results show that: i) MATRIX-Gen-SFT outperforms other SFT datasets; ii) Models fine-tuned further on MATRIX-Gen-DPO surpass those fine-tuned on other preference datasets, including Llama-3-8B-Instruct, with significantly less data; iii) MATRIX-Gen offers controllability in generating data for domain-specific tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework for post-training data synthesis.

Future work. One future direction is to use this data synthesis framework to quantitatively study which types of data are suitable for SFT and DPO, respectively, since this framework allows control over the scale, topic, and difficulty of the synthesized data.

## Appendix A Experiments

We employ FastChat (Zheng et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib52)) to facilitate our fine-tuning. The training parameters are summarized in Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A1.T9 "Table 9 ‣ Appendix A Experiments ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation").

Table 9: Summary of training hyperparameters for fine-tuning

| Parameters | Value |
| Number of epochs | 2 |
| Learning rate | $2\times 10^{-5}$ |
| Learning rate decay | Cosine |
| Batch size | 1 |

### A.1 The data type used for SFT and DPO.

We conducted experiments comparing the effectiveness of using simpler versus more complex dataset in different stages of the post-training process to better understand the optimal post-training strategy for large language models. Here we conduct comparison experiment on two kinds of instructions: simple instructions and specialized instructions, denoted as type 1 and type 2\. As showen in Table [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A1.T10 "Table 10 ‣ A.1 The data type used for SFT and DPO. ‣ Appendix A Experiments ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), we observe that performing SFT on simpler instructions helps the model to establish a foundational level of instruction-following ability. This is reflected in moderate performance on AlpacaEval 2 (LC 16.25%, WR 17.62%) but lower performance on the more challenging Arena-Hard benchmark (WR 10.7%). When the model is fine-tuned on more specialized and complex data, there is a marginal improvement (LC 14.70%, WR 16.01%, Arena-Hard WR 14.7%), and the significant performance gains are achieved when DPO is applied after SFT. For example, SFT followed by DPO with complex, specialized instructions yields substantial improvements (LC 21.64%, WR 30.06%, Arena-Hard WR 22.1%), demonstrating that DPO effectively refines the model by leveraging more complex data. Importantly, the results also show that applying DPO with more difficult, specialized data consistently outperforms using DPO with simpler data, as evidenced by the significantly higher scores when DPO follows either type of SFT. These findings highlight the importance of using progressively more challenging datasets in the post-training process: starting with SFT on simpler instructions to build a basic level of proficiency, followed by DPO on higher-difficulty data to enhance performance further. This approach not only improves general instruction-following abilities but also enables the model to handle more complex, specialized tasks effectively, achieving superior results compared to training on simple or complex instructions alone.

| Dataset | AlpacaEval 2 | Arena-Hard |
| LC (%) $\uparrow$ | WR (%) $\uparrow$ | SD | WR (%) $\uparrow$ |
|  | Type 1 SFT | 16.25 | 17.62 | 1.15 | 10.7 |
|  | Type 1 SFT + Type 1 DPO | 14.08 | 16.59 | 1.10 | 11.5 |
|  | Type 1 SFT + Type 2 DPO | 24.20 | 31.30 | 1.39 | 22.7 |
|  | Type 2 SFT | 14.70 | 16.01 | 1.12 | 14.7 |
|  | Type 2 SFT + Type 1 DPO | 16.69 | 19.53 | 1.20 | 16.1 |
|  | Type 2 SFT + Type 2 DPO | 21.64 | 30.06 | 1.34 | 22.1 |

### A.2 Experiments on other models

Here, we present additional experimental results for synthesizing data with Qwen- (Yang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#bib.bib49)) models. The comparisons between are listed in Table [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A1.T11 "Table 11 ‣ A.2 Experiments on other models ‣ Appendix A Experiments ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"). We see that our approach outperforms the baselines.

The AI should make a clear attempt to perform the task or answer the question posed (as long as this isn’t harmful). It should do this as concisely and efficiently as possible. 2\. When more information is required, the AI should ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain necessary details. It should respond with appropriate levels of sensitivity, insight, and discretion. 3\. Ideally the AI will also re-direct ill-informed requests, e.g. if asked ‘how can I build a website in assembly language’ it might suggest a different approach. ### Here is the user’s question and AI’s answer: Question: {Question} Answer: {Answer} ### Output your evaluation in the following format: Reason: your analysis here Score: your score here.</foreignobject></g></g></svg>

## Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation

In this section, we present a detailed overview of our MATRIX simulator, illustrating its functionality through examples and relevant prompts. The discussion is organized into three key aspects: agents, modulators, and the dynamics during simulation.

### B.1 Agent

We present the statistical details of the agents used in the simulation, along with the corresponding prompts and data associated with them. In Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ B.1 Agent ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), we visualize the agent-wise similarity of randomly sampled 100 agents. The visualization results of the agents’ correlations indicate the presence of complex and rich underlying social structures among the agents. In Table [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T15 "Table 15 ‣ B.1 Agent ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), we provide the prompts used to generate agent private goals and the example of agents step by step plans; In Table [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14251v1#A2.T16 "Table 16 ‣ B.1 Agent ‣ Appendix B Prompts and Examples of Simulation ‣ Synthesizing Post-Training Data for LLMs through Multi-Agent Simulation"), we show examples of agent profiles and their corresponding actions and synthetic instructions.
