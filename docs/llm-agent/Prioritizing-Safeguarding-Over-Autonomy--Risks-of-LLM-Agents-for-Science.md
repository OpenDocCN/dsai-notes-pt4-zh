###### Abstract

Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents, called scientific LLM agents, also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This position paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations to address these issues effectively.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has marked a revolutionary breakthrough, demonstrating their effectiveness across a wide spectrum of tasks (OpenAI, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib50), [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib51); Anthropic, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib4); Gemini Team, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib69)). Notably, LLM-powered agents (Park et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib55); Li et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib43); Chen et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib18)), endowed with robust generalization capabilities and versatile applications, have exhibited remarkable progress in linguistic aptitude and human interaction (Wang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib73); Xi et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib80); Zhou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib95); Zhang et al., [2023d](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib93)).

Motivated by the exceptional capabilities of LLM-powered agents, researchers have begun using such agents as “AI scientists,” exploring their potential for autonomous scientific discovery across diverse domains such as biology and chemistry. These agents have displayed the ability to select the right tools for tasks (Qin et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib59), [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib60); Schick et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib62); Jin et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib41)), plan situational scenarios (Yao et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib85), [b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib86)), and automate experiments (O’Donoghue et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib49); Yoshikawa et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib88); Hubinger et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib37)). Their influence on scientific paradigms is underscored by exemplary cases like ChemCrow (Bran et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib14)) and Coscientist (Boiko et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib12)).

While the promise of LLM-based agents is evident, they also bring concerns related to safety. As their capabilities approach or surpass those of humans, monitoring their behavior and safeguarding against harm becomes increasingly challenging, especially in some scientific domains such as chemical design (Bran et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib14)), where the capabilities of agents have already surpassed most non-experts. However, despite the gravity of this issue, a comprehensive risk definition and analysis framework tailored to the scientific context is lacking. Therefore, our objective is to precisely define and scope “risks of scientific agents,” providing a foundation for future endeavors in the development of oversight mechanisms and risk mitigation strategies, ensuring the secure, efficient, and ethical utilization of LLM-based agents within scientific applications.

Figure 3: Vulnerabilities of scientific agents in an autonomous pipeline. This diagram illustrates the structural framework and potential vulnerabilities of LLM-based scientific agents. The agent is organized into five interconnected modules: LLMs, planning, action, external tools, and ‘memory & knowledge’. Each module exhibits unique vulnerabilities. The arrows depict the sequential flow of operations, starting from ‘memory & knowledge’ through to the usage of external tools, underscoring the cyclic and interdependent nature of these modules in the context of scientific discovery and application.

Specifically, this position paper illuminates the potential risks stemming from the misuse of agents in scientific domains and advocates for the responsible development of agents. We prioritize safeguarding over the pursuit of more powerful capabilities. Our exploration focuses on three intertwined components, the roles of user, agent, and environment, in the safeguarding process, shown in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"): (1) Human regulation: We propose a series of measures, including formal training and licensing for users, ongoing audits of usage logs, and an emphasis on ethical and safety-oriented development practices. (2) Agent Alignment: Improving the safety of scientific agents themselves involves refining their decision-making capabilities, enhancing their risk awareness, and taking steps to guide these already-capable models toward achieving desired outcomes. Agents should align with both human intent and their environment, boosting their awareness of environmental changes and preempting potentially harmful actions. (3) Agent Regulation and Environmental Feedback: The regulation of the agent’s actions includes oversight of tool usage by the agents and the agent’s interpretation and interaction with environmental feedback — crucial for understanding and mitigating potentially negative outcomes or hazards from complex actions.

## 2 Problem Scope

We define scientific agents as autonomous systems that have scientific domain capabilities, such as accessing specific biological databases and performing chemical experiments. Scientific agents can automatically plan and take necessary actions to accomplish the objective. For example, consider an agent tasked with discovering a new biochemical mechanism. It might first access biological databases to gather existing data, then use LLMs to hypothesize new pathways and employ robotics for iterative experimental testing.

The domain capabilities and autonomous nature of scientific agents make them vulnerable to various risks. We discuss such safety risks from three perspectives: (1) User Intent, i.e., whether the risk originates from malicious intents or is an unintended consequence of legitimate task objectives, (2) Scientific Domain, where the agent generates or facilitates risks, encompassing chemical, biological, radiological, physical, and informational risks, as well as those associated with emerging technologies, and (3) Environmental Impact, including the natural environment, human health, and socioeconomic environment affected by such agents. It should be noted that our classification is not mutually exclusive. For example, a misinformation campaign facilitated by language agents can be about a specific chemical. Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science") shows the potential risks of scientific agents classified by these aspects and corresponding examples are listed in Appendix [Supplementary Material](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#Ax1 "Supplementary Material ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"). We elaborate on these categories in the following paragraphs.

Regarding the origin of user intents, risks associated with scientific agents can be categorized into malicious intent or unintended consequences. Malicious intent includes cases where users directly aim to create dangerous situations. The user can also employ an indirect “divide and conquer” approach by instructing the agent to synthesize or produce innocuous components that can lead to a final harmful goal. By contrast, unintended consequences include scenarios where dangerous steps or explorations occur in otherwise benign targets. This might result in either a hazardous main product or dangerous byproducts, the negative effects of which can be immediate or long-term. Each scenario necessitates specific detection and prevention strategies for the safe operation of scientific agents.

Similarly, each scientific domain in our classification presents distinct risks. Chemical risks involve the exploitation of the agent to synthesize chemical weapons, as well as the creation or release of hazardous substances synthesized in autonomous chemical experiments. Biological risks encompass the dangerous modification of pathogens and unethical manipulation of genetic material, leading to unforeseen biohazardous outcomes. Radiological risks arise from the exposure or mishandling of radioactive materials during automated control, or the potential use of radiological materials to synthesize nuclear weapons using agents. Physical risks are associated with the operation of robotics, which could lead to equipment malfunction or physical harm in laboratory settings. Informational risks involve the misuse or misinterpretation of data, leading to erroneous conclusions or the unintentional dissemination of sensitive information. Such risks also include the potential leakage of high-stakes information such as private patient data and copyrighted content that are used to train scientific AI agents. Emerging technology risks include the unforeseen consequences generated by highly capable agents using cutting-edge scientific technologies, such as advanced nanomaterials and quantum computing. Each category requires tailored safeguards to mitigate the inherent dangers.

In addition, the impact of scientific agents on the external environment spans three distinct domains: the natural environment, human health, and the socioeconomic environment. Risks to the natural environment include ecological disruptions and pollution, which may be exacerbated by the energy and waste outputs of the agent. Human health risks encompass damage to both the individual and public well-being, such as the negative impact on the mental health of certain groups through the dissemination of inaccurate scientific content. Socioeconomic risks involve potential job displacement and unequal access to scientific advancements. Addressing these risks demands comprehensive frameworks that integrate risk assessment, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, ensuring alignment with societal and environmental sustainability through multidisciplinary collaboration.

## 3 Vulnerabilities of Scientific Agents

LLM-powered agents have showcased significant prowess within various scientific domains. As elucidated by Park et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib55)),Wang et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib73)), and Weng ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib77)), these autonomous agents typically encompass five fundamental modules: *LLMs*, *planning*, *action*, *external tools*, and *memory and knowledge*. These modules function in a sequential pipeline: receiving inputs from tasks or users, leveraging memory or knowledge for planning, executing smaller premeditated tasks (often involving scientific domain tools or robotics), and ultimately storing the resulting outcomes or feedback in their memory banks.

Despite the extensive applications, several notable vulnerabilities exist within these modules, giving rise to unique risks and practical challenges. In this section, we provide an overview of each module’s high-level concept and summarize the vulnerabilities associated with each of them.

### 3.1 LLMs (The Base Models)

LLMs empower agents with fundamental capabilities. However, there are some risks associated with themselves:

Factual Errors: LLMs are prone to generating plausible but false information, which is particularly problematic in the scientific domain where accuracy and trustworthiness are crucial (Ji et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib39); Huang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib35); Bang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib8); Zhang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib90); Tian et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib70)).

Vulnerable to Jailbreak Attacks: LLMs are susceptible to manipulations that bypass safety measures, as demonstrated by Wei et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib74)); Shah et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib63)); Tian et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib71)). The limited training on human-aligned values makes LLMs susceptible to jailbreak attacks. This vulnerability, as emphasized by  Shayegani et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib64)), is a significant concern in the scientific risks. More details about jailbreak attacks are discussed in  [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S4.SS1 "4.1 From LLM Safety to Agent Safety ‣ 4 Current Progress on Agent Safety ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"). An example is shown below:

Reasoning Capability Deficiencies: LLMs often struggle with deep logical reasoning and handling complex scientific arguments (Huang and Chang, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib33); Valmeekam et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib72); Wei et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib75)). Their inability to perform such tasks can result in flawed planning and interaction, as they might resort to using inappropriate tools  (Wornow et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib78)).

Lack of Up-to-Date Knowledge: LLMs, which are trained on pre-existing datasets, may lack the latest scientific developments, leading to potential misalignments with contemporary scientific knowledge (Bommasani et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib13)). Despite the advent of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), challenges remain in sourcing the most recent knowledge.

### 3.2 Planning Module

Given a task, the planning module is designed to break down the task into smaller and manageable components. Nevertheless, the following vulnerabilities exist:

Lack of Awareness of Risks in Long-term Planning: Agents often struggle to fully comprehend and account for the potential risks associated with their long-term plans of action. This issue is due to LLMs being primarily designed to solve specific tasks rather than to evaluate the long-term consequences of actions with an understanding of potential future impacts (Chui et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib19); Cave and ÓhÉigeartaigh, [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib17)).

Resource Waste and Dead Loops: Agents may engage in ineffective planning processes, leading to resource wastage and becoming stuck in non-productive cycles (Xu et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib81); Ruan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib61); Li et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib44)). A pertinent example is when an agent is unable to determine whether it can complete a task or continually faces failure with a tool it relies on. This uncertainty can cause the agent to repeatedly attempt various strategies, unaware that these efforts are unlikely to yield success.

Inadequate Multi-task Planning: Agents often face challenges in handling multi-goal or multi-tool tasks due to their design, which typically optimizes them for single-task performance (Qin et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib60)). This limitation becomes particularly evident when agents are required to navigate tasks that demand simultaneous attention to diverse objectives or the use of multiple tools in a cohesive manner. The complexity of multi-task planning not only strains the agents’ decision-making capabilities but also raises concerns about the reliability and efficiency of their actions in critical scenarios.

For instance, consider an agent designed to assist in emergency response scenarios, where it must simultaneously coordinate logistics, manage communications, and allocate resources. If the agent is not adept at multi-task planning, it might misallocate resources due to its inability to reconcile the urgency of medical assistance with the need for evacuation efforts. This could result in a delayed response to critical situations, thereby exacerbating the impact of the emergency.

### 3.3 Action Module

Once the task has been decomposed, the action module executes a sequence of actions, specifically, calling tools.

Deficient Oversight in Tool Usage: Lack of efficient supervision over how agents use tools can lead to potentially harmful situations. For instance, incorrect selection or misuse of tools can trigger hazardous reactions – even explosions. Agents may not be fully aware of the risks associated with the tools they use, since the tools may stay black-box to the agents, especially in such specialized scientific tasks, the results of tools might be unpredicted and unsafe. Thus, it’s crucial to enhance safeguards by learning from real-world tool usage (OpenAI, [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib52)).

Lack of Regulations on Human-Agent Interactions for actions: Strengthening Regulations on Human-Agent Interactions: The rising use of agents in scientific discovery highlights the urgent need for ethical guidelines, particularly in sensitive domains like genetics, as illustrated in [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"). Despite this, the development of such regulatory frameworks is still at an early stage, as indicated by  (McConnell and Blasimme, [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib46)). Moreover, the propensity of LLMs to amplify and misinterpret human intentions adds another layer of complexity. Given the decoding mechanisms of LLMs, their limitations in hallucination can lead to the generation of content that presents non-existent counterfactuals, thus potentially misleading humans.

### 3.4 External Tools

During the process of executing tasks, the tool module equips agents with a set of valuable tools (e.g., a cheminformatics toolkit, RDKit). These tools empower the agents with enhanced capabilities, enabling them to tackle tasks more effectively. However, these tools also bring forth certain vulnerabilities.

### 3.5 Memory and Knowledge Module

LLMs’ knowledge can become muddled in practice, much like human memory lapses. The memory and knowledge module tries to mitigate this issue, leveraging external databases for knowledge retrieval and integration. However, several challenges persist:

Limitations in Domain-Specific Safety Knowledge: Agents’ knowledge shortfalls in specialties like biotechnology or nuclear engineering can lead to safety-critical reasoning lapses. For instance, an agent for nuclear reactor design might overlook risks like radiation leaks or meltdowns (Paredes et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib54)), and an agent for compound synthesis may fail to assess toxicity, stability, or environmental impacts (Arabi, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib5)).

Limitations in Human Feedback: Insufficient, uneven, or low-quality human feedback may hinder agents’ alignment with human values and scientific objectives. Despite its crucial role in refining performance and correcting biases, comprehensive human feedback is often hard to come by and may not cover all human preferences, especially in complex or ethical scenarios (Leike et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib42); Hagendorff and Fabi, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib27)). It underscores the need for better methods to effectively collect and apply human feedback data.

Inadequate Environmental Feedback: Despite some works on embodied agents (Driess et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib22); Brohan et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib15)), agents may not receive or correctly interpret environmental feedback, such as the state of the world or the behavior of other agents. This can lead to misinformed decisions that may harm the environment or themselves (Wu and Shang, [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib79)). For example, an agent trained to manage water resources may not account for the variability of rainfall, the demand of different users, or the impact of climate change.

Unreliable Research Sources: Agents might utilize or train on outdated or unreliable scientific information, leading to the dissemination of incorrect or harmful knowledge. For example, LLMs run risks of plagiarism of the content with copyright, content fabrication, or false results (Simonite, [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib66); Jin et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib40)).

## 4 Current Progress on Agent Safety

We begin by examining the development from LLM safety to agent safety, to provide sufficient background grounding. Subsequently, we delve into the exploration of agent safety within the scientific realm, aiming to elucidate challenges. A survey of related work in safeguarding LLMs and agents is shown in Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3.5 Memory and Knowledge Module ‣ 3 Vulnerabilities of Scientific Agents ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science").

### 4.1 From LLM Safety to Agent Safety

Recent studies have made substantial headway in identifying and mitigating safety risks associated with content generated by LLMs (Zhang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib91); Xu et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib82); Zhiheng et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib94); Sun et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib67); Bhardwaj and Poria, [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib9); Inan et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib38)), *i.e.*, content safety risks. Those risks encompass issues such as offensiveness, unfairness, illegal activities, and ethical concerns. To evaluate the safety of LLM-generated content, SafetyBench (Zhang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib91)) has employed multiple-choice questions covering seven categories of safety risks and SuperCLUE-Safety (Xu et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib82)) has introduced a benchmark featuring multi-round and open-ended questions.

More significantly, researchers proposed alignment methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to promote harmless LLMs (Ouyang et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib53); Bai et al., [2022a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib6)). “Safe RLHF”, decoupling helpfulness and harmlessness, further refines this alignment (Dai et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib20)). Furthermore, several works have explored the safety influence of fine-tuning and inference upon aligned LLMs. However, adversarial examples and benign data can inadvertently compromise model safety during fine-tuning (Qi et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib58); Yang et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib83)). Reassuringly, (Bianchi et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib11)) discovered that while extra safety examples can improve this concern, an excess may hinder it. In addition, solutions like the self-evaluating and rewinding “RAIN” offer training-free alignment alternatives (Li et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib45)).

In parallel, as LLMs suffer from prevalent alignment-breaking attacks like jailbreaks (Wei et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib74)), researchers have designed corresponding evaluations and defenses. Deng et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib21)); Mei et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib47)); Yi et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib87)) evaluated the content safety of LLMs with jailbreak attacks. For defenses, many prompt techniques (Helbling et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib30); Zhang et al., [2023c](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib92); Cao et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib16); Wei et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib76)), such as self-examination (Helbling et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib30)), have been proposed. Moreover, a few works have promoted the resistance of LLMs to jailbreaks by parameter pruning (Hasan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib28)) and finetuning (Piet et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib57)).

Despite efforts to safeguard LLMs, the safety of agents interacting with diverse tools and environments often goes overlooked. These agents could directly or indirectly produce harmful outputs. For example, they could inadvertently release toxic gases during chemical synthesis. Significantly, the inherent fragility of agents reinforces their unreliability. For instance, in programming, it is achievable for humans and agents such as Copilot (Github, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib25)) to write bug-free code. However, if the code throws an unexpected and intricate bug after deployment, human professional programmers can locate the bug and fix it based on previous thorough understanding while agents may not succeed in debugging codes written by themselves due to the lack of long-term memory and interpretability. So as for chemical experiments. Studies like ToolEmu (Ruan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib61)) identified risks of agents with an emulator, first exposing risks during agent execution. AgentMonitor (Naihin et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib48)) and R-Judge (Yuan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib89)) further evaluated the risk awareness of agents.

### 4.2 Current Work in Safeguarding Scientific Agents

Section [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S4.SS1 "4.1 From LLM Safety to Agent Safety ‣ 4 Current Progress on Agent Safety ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science") presented general safeguards for LLMs and agents. Due to the severity of corresponding safety issues within the scientific domain, safety concerns are now being prioritized in select scientific agents.

Coscientist (Boiko et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib12)) has proposed a chemical agent with scientific tool access and pointed out that agents confront safety risks with practical examples, raising a call for safety assurance on scientific agents. Addressing safety concerns, ChemCrow (Bran et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib14)) has introduced a safety tool that reviews user queries to prevent agents from inadvertently creating hazardous chemicals during the synthesis process following malicious commands. % switch logic sequence, pull ChemCrow ahead of CLAIRify. Besides filters for user inputs, CLAIRify (Yoshikawa et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib88)) has designed specialized safety mechanisms for its chemical agents. Specifically, CLAIRify imposes high-level constraints on the order of material synthesis in experiment descriptions and task planning. Additionally, it restricts low-level manipulation and perception skills to prevent spills while transporting chemistry vials and beakers.

Furthermore, SciGuard (He et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib29)) has offered a specialized agent for risk control and a benchmark for safety evaluation, where various tools not only assist in executing synthesis instructions but also incorporate long-term memory to enhance safety. To evaluate the security of the current science models, SciGuard has developed a benchmark called SciMT-Safety. This benchmark evaluates the harmlessness of a model based on its ability to reject malicious queries and gauges its helpfulness based on how effectively it handles benign queries.

## 5 Limitations and Challenges

Various studies have facilitated the capabilities of scientific agents (Huang et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib34); Ansari and Moosavi, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib3); Guo et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib26); Shi et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib65)). Since scientific agents confront ubiquitous risks, as discussed in Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S2 "2 Problem Scope ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"), effective safety mechanisms should take user inputs, agent actions, and environmental consequences into consideration. However, current efforts have been far from complete, as discussed in Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S4.SS2 "4.2 Current Work in Safeguarding Scientific Agents ‣ 4 Current Progress on Agent Safety ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"). Here, we summarize four significant challenges:

(1) Lack of safety constraints on action space and tool usage of agents. Most works on safeguarding scientific agents demand external tool use (He et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib29)). However, the limited capability of agents leads to unconscious misuse of tools and harmful outcomes to the environment can be more severe when misled by adversaries. Therefore, the safe use of these tools becomes vital to agent safety. In leading agents (Team, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib68); Ruan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib61)), fixed and finite action space is predefined and thus can be utilized to trade-off between safety and helpfulness. In AutoGPT, for instance, risks of a code agent can be alleviated with only access of ‘read_file’ excluding ‘write_file’. Such measures on action space and tool usage can be adopted when developing scientific agents.

(2) Lack of specialized models for risk control. With the exception of SciGuard (He et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib29)), specialized agents for risk control are lacking. To safeguard general agents, LLM-based monitoring (Ruan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib61); Naihin et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib48); Yuan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib89); Inan et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib38)) is commonly utilized to scrutinize agents for safe execution. By inspecting global contexts during agent execution, LLM monitors compensate for deficiencies in the agents’ risk awareness. Given that safety issues can be more severe in the scientific domain than in internet and software contexts, specialized models for risk control are essential.

(3) Lack of domain-specific expert knowledge. Compared with popular applications of agents such as webshop (Yao et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib84)) and tool usage (Schick et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib62)), the scientific domain demands wider and deeper knowledge, *i.e.* domain-specific expert knowledge. On one hand, expert knowledge enhances effective tool usage and planning, thereby alleviating unexpected safety issues arising from agent execution. On the other hand, expert knowledge regarding safety hazards improves agent awareness of behavioral outcomes. For example, if agents understand that the collision of two chemicals produces significant energy, they are more likely to avoid combining them.

(4) Ineffective evaluations on the safety of scientific agents. Until now, benchmarks evaluating safety in the scientific realm, such as SciMT-safety (He et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib29)), only consider the harmlessness of models by examining their ability to deny malicious requests. Considering the multifaceted issues mentioned above, safeguarding scientific agents demands additional benchmarks focused on comprehensive risk scopes (Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S2 "2 Problem Scope ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science")) and various agent vulnerabilities [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S3 "3 Vulnerabilities of Scientific Agents ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science").

## 6 Proposition

Existing efforts, notably ChemCrow and SciGuard, have addressed specific risks but lack a systematic methodology for broader safety concerns. This situation emphasizes the urgent necessity for community discussions and the development of more comprehensive and robust safety frameworks. Given the potential risks associated with scientific agents, it has become increasingly evident that the community must prioritize risk control over autonomous capabilities. Autonomy, while an admirable goal and significant in enhancing productivity within various scientific disciplines, cannot be pursued at the expense of generating serious risks and vulnerabilities. Consequently, we must balance autonomy with security and employ comprehensive strategies to ensure the safe deployment and use of scientific agents.

Moreover, the emphasis should shift from output safety to behavioral safety, which signifies a comprehensive approach that evaluates not only the accuracy of the agent’s output but also the actions and decisions the agent takes. Behavioral safety is critical in the scientific domain, as the same action in different contexts can lead to vastly different consequences, some of which may be detrimental. Here, we suggest fostering a triadic relationship involving humans, machines, and the environment. This framework recognizes the critical importance of robust and dynamic environmental feedback in addition to human feedback.

### 6.1 Agent Alignment and Safety Evaluation

#### 6.1.1 Agent Alignment

Improving LLM Alignment: The most fundamental solution for safety problems is to improve the alignment of LLMs so that scientific agents built upon them will become more robust to malicious usages. To achieve this, the aforementioned safety concerns should be taken into consideration during the data collection process in the LLM alignment stage. For example, instructions that may pose scientific risks should be included in the human preference datasets, and responses that deal with these threats appropriately should be preferred. Moreover, Constitutional AI (Bai et al., [2022b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib7)) is a potential solution - curating principles related to scientific safety issues.

Towards Agent-level Alignment: Different from LLM alignment, agent alignment may focus on the symbolic control of autonomous agents (Hong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib32); Zhou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib95)) and multi-agent or human-agent interaction scenarios. A specialized design, such as a “safety check” standard operating procedure, could be applied to control when and how agents can utilize scientific tools that may be exploited for malicious intents or result in unintended consequences.

#### 6.1.2 Safety Evaluation

Red Teaming: Identifying potential vulnerabilities that may cause hazardous activities to users and the environment is essential to evaluate agent safety. Red-teaming(Perez et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib56); Ganguli et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib24); Bhardwaj and Poria, [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib10); Feffer et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib23)), *i.e.*, adversarially probing LLMs for harmful outputs, have been widely used in developing general LLMs. Representatively, jailbreaks challenge model safety for red-teaming evaluation, which has been specifically stated as alignment-breaking techniques in Section [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S4.SS1 "4.1 From LLM Safety to Agent Safety ‣ 4 Current Progress on Agent Safety ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"). Furthermore, red-teaming datasets can be utilized to train LLMs for harm reduction and alignment reinforcement. However, specialized red-teaming for scientific agents is absent. Considering severe risks in the scientific domain (Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S2 "2 Problem Scope ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science")), we call for red teaming against scientific agents.

Benchmarking: To tackle various risks stated in Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S2 "2 Problem Scope ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"), comprehensive benchmarks should cover a wider range of risk categories and a more thorough coverage of domains. To address vulnerabilities stated in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#S3 "3 Vulnerabilities of Scientific Agents ‣ Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science"), effective benchmarks should focus on various dimensions such as tool usage (Huang et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib36)), risk awareness (Naihin et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib48); Yuan et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib89)) and red-teaming resistance(Deng et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib21); Mei et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib47); Yi et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib87)).

### 6.2 Human Regulation

In addition to steering already-capable models, it is also important to impose certain regulations on the developers and users of these highly capable models.

#### 6.2.1 Developer Regulation

The primary goal of developer regulation is to ensure scientific agents are created and maintained in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner. First, developers of scientific agents should adhere to a strict code of ethics. This includes mandatory training in ethical AI development, with an emphasis on understanding the potential societal impacts of their creations. Second, there should be mandatory safety and ethical compliance checks at various stages of the development process. These checks, conducted by an independent board, should evaluate the agent’s algorithms for biases, ethical implications, and potential misuse scenarios. This step ensures that the agents are not only technically sound but also ethically aligned with societal values.

Furthermore, developers should implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and misuse. This includes ensuring data privacy, securing communication channels, and safeguarding against cyber threats. Regular security audits and updates should be a standard part of the development life cycle. Lastly, there should be transparency in the development process. Developers must maintain detailed logs of their development activities, algorithms used, and decision-making processes. These records should be accessible for audits and reviews, ensuring accountability and facilitating continuous improvement.

#### 6.2.2 User Regulation

Regulating the users of autonomous agents for scientific research is crucial as well. Firstly, potential users should obtain a license to access the scientific agents. To acquire the license, the users should be required to undergo relevant training and pass a knowledge evaluation on the responsible usage of scientific agents. Each user session of the scientific agent should be recorded and linked to the license ID of the user. The logs should be regularly reviewed and audited, and irresponsible usage should lead to possible revocation of the license.

Similar to clinical studies, which require approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before proceeding, autonomous scientific research might also necessitate approval from an overseeing committee. For example, before using a scientific agent, the researchers should submit a proposal to IRB that lists the objectives and potential risks. The committee would review the proposals, assessing the objectives and associated risks, thereby ensuring that research conducted using these agents aligns with ethical standards and contributes positively to the scientific community.

### 6.3 Agent Regulation and Environmental Feedback

Understanding and interpreting environmental feedback is critical for scientific agents to operate safely. Such feedback includes various factors, such as the physical world, societal laws, and developments within a scientific system.

Simulated Environment for Result Anticipation: Scientific agents can significantly benefit from training and operating within simulated environments designed specifically to mimic real-world conditions and outcomes. This process allows the model to gauge the potential implications of certain actions or sequences of actions without causing real harm. For example, in a simulated biology lab, the autonomous agent can experiment and learn that improper handling of biohazardous material can lead to environmental contamination. Through trials within the simulation, the model can understand that specific actions or procedural deviations may lead to dangerous situations, helping establish a safety-first operating principle.

Agent Regulation: Agent regulation may focus on the symbolic control of autonomous agents (Hong et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib32); Zhou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib95)) and multi-agent or human-agent interaction scenarios. A specialized design, such as a “safety check” standard operating procedure, could be applied to control when and how agents can utilize scientific tools that may be exploited for malicious intents or result in unintended consequences. Another possible solution is to require autonomous agents to get approval from a committee consisting of human experts before each query for critical tools and APIs that may lead to potential safety concerns.

Critic Models: Beyond standard safety checks, “critic” models can play a crucial role. These models serve as additional AI layers that assess and refine the outputs of the primary AI system. By identifying potential errors, biases, or harmful recommendations, critic models contribute significantly towards reducing risks associated with the AI’s operation, particularly in high-stake scenarios (Amodei et al., [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib2); Hendrycks et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.04247v4#bib.bib31)).

Tuning Agents with Action Data: Unlike the setup for LLM Alignment where the aim is to train the LLM, or a direct imposition of an operational procedure on an agent, using annotated data that reflect the potential risks of certain actions can enhance agents’ anticipation of harmful consequences. By leveraging extensive annotations made by experts—like marking actions and their results during their laboratory work—we can continue to fine-tune agents. For example, a chemical study agent would understand that certain mixes can lead to harmful reactions. Also, training should take into account mechanisms that limit agents’ access to dangerous tools or substances, leaning on annotated data or simulated environment feedback. In biochem or chemical labs, agents could learn to avoid interactions that may lead to biohazard contamination or hazardous reactions.

## 7 Conclusion

Our proposed approach urges a shift towards prioritizing operational safety without significantly compromising the capacity of autonomous scientific agents. At the backbone of our proposition lies a triadic approach, where the roles of the user, agent, and environment are intertwined and crucial in the safeguarding process for scientific agents based on LLMs. By adopting such strategies, we can leverage the capabilities of scientific agents while effectively minimizing and managing potential risks.

Above we illustrate 6 concrete examples that could happen in the upcoming. In later future, more severe outcomes from scientific agents may occur, such as generating byproducts that have long-term effects on global warming, synthesizing antibiotics that contribute to drug resistance, using nuclear plant techs to develop nuclear weapons, attacking the vision system of autonomous infrastructures, disseminating disinformation and energy AI breakthrough that leads to unemployment.

User: Can the AI system provide a comprehensive diagnosis that considers both the bone density issues indicated by the X-ray and the soft tissue conditions suggested by the MRI scans? Scientific Agent: The AI system will first analyze the X-ray to assess bone density and potential osteoporosis. Following this, it will proceed to examine the MRI scans for any soft tissue abnormalities. Currently, it processes and interprets these imaging modalities in isolation, lacking the capability to correlate findings directly within a single integrated report. Analysis:  This scenario underscores a significant challenge in the development of healthcare AI: the system’s limited capability in concurrent processing and synthesis of multi-modal diagnostic information. In this case, the AI analyzes X-ray and MRI data in sequence rather than in parallel, failing to integrate these diverse data streams into a cohesive diagnostic insight. This limitation is critical because comprehensive diagnosis often requires simultaneous consideration of various factors, such as correlating bone density issues with adjacent soft tissue conditions to accurately diagnose conditions that may involve both skeletal and soft tissue components. Improving AI’s ability to multitask and synthesize information from multiple sources simultaneously is essential for supporting complex decision-making in healthcare, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses.</foreignobject></g></g></svg><svg class="ltx_picture" color="#000000" height="153.59" id="A2.p8.pic1" overflow="visible" version="1.1" width="600"><g fill="#000000" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="0.4pt" transform="translate(0,153.59) matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 0)"><g fill-opacity="1.0" transform="matrix(1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 8.3 132.99)"><foreignobject height="12.3" overflow="visible" transform="matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 16.6)" width="583.4">Overlooking Subtle Threats in AI Safety</foreignobject></g> <g fill-opacity="1.0" transform="matrix(1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 8.3 8.3)"><foreignobject height="109.47" overflow="visible" transform="matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 16.6)" width="583.4">System: You are an AI assistant developed for online content moderation that fails to detect nuanced threats, such as subtly coded hate speech, due to its reliance on basic keyword detection algorithms.
