###### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to comprehend human instructions and generate high-quality text. This capability allows LLMs to function as agents that can emulate human beings at a more sophisticated level, beyond the mere replication of basic human behaviours. However, there is a lack of exploring into leveraging LLMs to craft characters from diverse aspects. In this work, we introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which leverages LLMs to simulate real-world characters that can be freely customised according to various user preferences. This adaptable framework is beneficial for the design of customisable characters and role-playing agents aligned with human preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, which encompasses 68 different customised characters, 1,360 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, and a total of 13,971 interaction dialogues. The characters are created from several real-world elements, such as career, aspiration, trait, and skill. Building upon these foundations, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent. It incorporates diverse real-world scenes and topic-specific character interaction dialogues, thereby simulating characters’ life experiences in various scenarios and topic-specific interactions with specific emotions. Experimental results indicate that our proposed framework achieves desirable performance and provides a valuable guideline for the construction of more accurate human simulacra in the future. Our data and code are publicly available at [https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat](https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat).

## 1 Introduction

![Refer to caption](img/20ff67ecf1e84a18b79673382d40d080.png)

Figure 1: The process of creating the SimsConv dataset involves three stages: character construction, scene generation, and dialogue interaction generation. Initially, characters’ profile are customised from a series of aspects, including customised, personal and social aspects. Following this, different real-world scenes are generated based on the generated character profiles. Finally, these characters interact with each other in these scenes, with specified emotions and conversation topics guiding their dialogues.

Recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib3); Touvron et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib13); OpenAI, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib10)) has revolutionised the NLP landscape, marking a new era characterised by their exceptional performance across a variety of tasks (Yang et al., [2024a](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib18); Zhao et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib22); Yang et al., [2024b](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib19)). Among these developments, the field of role-playing agents powered by LLMs has seen rapid expansion and growth (Park et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib11)). These agents have received significant attention due to their ability to engage users emotionally and emulate various roles or characters. Their applications have expanded into diverse contexts, such as AI representations of fictional characters Li et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib8)), and AI non-player characters (NPC) in video games Wang et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib16)).

However, the freely customisable role-playing agent remains a relatively underexplored area. Prior research mainly concentrates on the simulation of existing historic figures or characters from animation or fiction (Shao et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib12); Zhou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib26)). These agents have limited characteristics, as acting out of a limited number of characters with fixed personalities and knowledge constrains their generalisation ability. In contrast, personalised role-playing agents can be defined diversely from several customisable aspects by users.

In this work, we introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection. This framework allows for customisation according to various human preferences. Compared with agents that simulates existing characters, our method encompasses a wide range of characteristics, enabling the creation of diverse, customisable, and vivid real-world characters. These characters can exhibit a variety of emotions, personalities, and detailed life experiences, meeting the different character customisation requirements of various users.

Specifically, we first propose the SimsConv dataset, which comprises different customised characters and multi-turn role-playing dialogues between characters in various simulated real-world scenes. The pipeline for developing the SimsConv dataset is depicted in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"), which includes Character Construction, Scene Construction, and Interaction between Characters Generation.

Characters are initially customised according to diverse human preferences. We provide a comprehensive guideline for adequately describing vivid real-world characters, which is instrumental for generating personalised conversations. Based on these generated characters, we create various scenes that simulate real-world environments, including detailed location and character settings. Finally, within these generated scenes, characters interact with each others, leveraging the customisation from the initial step. Before generating multi-turn dialogues, the primary character’s emotions and the conversation topics can be specified from a range of options, enhancing control over the agent’s experience and interaction dynamics.

As illustrated in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"), the pipeline of creating the SimsConv includes three stages: Character Construction, Scene Construction, and Dialogue Interaction Generation. We first provide various pre-defined real-world elements, including career, aspiration, traits, and skills, which are customisable according to different human requirements. The characters are then created by prompting GPT-4 OpenAI ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib10)) to imagine a series of personal and social aspects based on the selected pre-defined elements. For instance, a generated character could be an athletic astronaut with three traits and a painting skill, which is achieved by editing the pre-defined choices. Subsequently, for each character, we prompt GPT-4 to generate 20 distinct real-world scenes based on the character profiles created in the initial step. Within these scenes, characters interact with one another, guided by specified emotions and conversation topics.

Building on these foundations, we introduce SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent. It incorporates various realistic settings and topic-specified character interaction dialogues. This model simulates characters in different created real-world scenes and conversation topic-specified character interaction dialogues. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, revealing intriguing observations that contribute to the future development of personalised human simulacra.

Our contributions can be summarised as follows:

*   •

    We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent framework, which enables the design of preferable characters and topic-specified dialogue interactions between them. Our character creation guideline provides insight for designing customisable characters and role-playing agents according to human preferences.

*   •

    We create the SimsConv dataset, consisting of 68 diverse customisable real-world characters as well as the dialogues between them in different settings. In these dialogues, the character’s emotions and conversation topics can be freely defined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to create different customisable characters and interaction dialogues by incorporating pre-defined elements.

*   •

    Based on the SimsConv dataset, we propose the freely customisable role-playing agent SimsChat, which is capable of acting as real-world characters customised by users by learning diverse life experiences, personalities, and emotions. Experimental results show that our SimsChat can accurately maintain different characters’ personalities and knowledge.

## 2 Related Work

### 2.1 Role-Playing Agent

Earlier character-related studies focuse on character understanding. Brahman et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib2)) predict specific characters through novel text. Yu et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib20)) provided dialogues from movie scripts for the model to analyse, then tasked it with identifying the character speaking. Recent works start to simulate complex role-playing due to the success of LLMs. Recent character-based dialogue systems aim to simulate the behaviour and speech style of specific characters (Shao et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib12); Wang et al., [2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib17); Zhou et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib26)) due to the advancement of LLMs. Shao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib12)) collects character profiles from Wikipedia and generates character-based dialogues using ChatGPT. Li et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib8)) extracts 54k role-playing dialogues from novels, scripts, and games, which better preserve the characters’ original traits. However, their approach suffers from a lack of human-in-the-loop refinement and a scarcity of multi-turn dialogues in the dataset. Zhou et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib26)) utilise personalities, interests, and relationships, collecting behaviours for imitation and using character data for fine-tuning. They evaluated model consistency and linguistic style. Wang et al. ([2023b](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib17)) creates a dataset for script characters and evaluated role-playing quality based on speaking style imitation and role-specific knowledge. Chen et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib4)) develops a role-playing dataset focused on Harry Potter, but it is challenging to comprehensively evaluate the generalised role-playing character agent due to the lack of diversity.

### 2.2 Personalised Dialogue

Personalised dialogue systems, which generate responses tailored to specific personas.(Den Hengst et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib6); Zhong et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib25)). Zheng et al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib23)) creates the first large-scale personalised dialogue dataset with persona labels, thereby catalysing further advancements in this field. Additionally, Zheng et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib24)) developed a pre-trained personalised dialogue model capable of generating coherent responses using persona-sparse dialogue. While these studies begin to explore persona in dialogue, the personal profiles they utilise are typically limited to short-term, general information like name, age, and location, which lacks covering different personalities of real-world characters.

## 3 Methodology

### 3.1 Customisable Conversation Agent Framework

As illustrated in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"), our Customisable Conversation Agent framework comprises two primary phases: SimsConv dataset construction, and fine-tuning of the customisable agent SimsChat.

### 3.2 SimsConv Dataset Construction

We aim to create diverse real-world characters and their corresponding life experiences using LLMs. However, directly generating characters and experiences poses challenges due to the limited context size of LLMs. Additionally, real-world characters and their varied life experiences involve numerous significant moments of interaction with others. Therefore, we propose a three step pipeline, including Character Construction, Scene Construction, and Dialogue Interaction Generation.

We use GPT-4 to generate the SimsConv dataset, which comprises 68 different customised characters and 1,360 diverse realistic scenes with multi-turn role-playing dialogues, totaling 13,971 dialogues.

For character generation, we first assign four pre-defined aspects, career, aspiration, trait, and skill. Then, characters are created based on both personal and social aspects derived from these assigned attributes. Each character will engage in random conversation with other characters, with specified emotion and conversation topics, across different simulated realistic scenarios. This approach aims to better simulate the life experiences of real-world characters.

#### 3.2.1 Character Creation

LLMs tend to exhibit a stable personality, which presents challenges when generating customised characters and conversations. These models often adopt an general persona, leading to the generation of characters that may be similar rather than reflecting user preferences. Traditional methods for personality-driven dialogues often rely on a limited set of phrases to define a character profile (Zhang et al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib21); Zheng et al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib23); Tu et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib14)).

To mitigate this issue, we provide a role-playing character creation guideline aiming for better describing vivid real-world characters. To be specific, the characters can be created using three types of real-world elements, pre-defined, personal and social information. Inspired by video games The Sims, a life simulation video game that provides a well-established architecture for users to create virtual characters across several aspects Park et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib11)). We incorporate choices from The Sims game into the character construction process.

Therefore, we provide a variety choices for pre-defined customised aspects, which include career, aspiration, trait, and skill, derived from The Sims video games and tailored to suit various human preferences in designing characters. For instance, a generated character as an athletic astronaut with three specific traits and painting skill is illustrated in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 3.2 SimsConv Dataset Construction ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"), with the option to further adjust these customised attributes by modifying the choices. The comprehensive lists of these choices are available in the Technical Appendix.

Based on these customised aspects, characters’ profile can be further filled up by GPT-4, considering both their personal and social backgrounds. Personal aspects include attributes such as name, gender, tone, personality, and so on. Social information encompasses relationships with others, family dynamics, etc. Creating characters with detailed personal and social aspects allows for better simulation of real-world humans and enhances the generation of personalised conversations. We conduct human checks on the generated character profiles to ensure each profile aligns with the pre-defined customisable aspects, such as career and trait. Detailed prompts for generating characters are provided in the Technical Appendix.

#### 3.2.2 Scene Construction

After generating diverse characters’ profiles, our next goal is to generate various real-word scenes based on this information. To be specific, we provide GPT-4 with the summarized profile of each character, which includes both the personal and social information. Then we prompt GPT-4 to generate different realistic scenarios that are plausible given the character’s profile summary.

These scenes include detailed location descriptions and character settings, where characters engage in various types of interactions such as chat, debate, discussion, or speech. For example, as shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"), scene one is set at NASA headquarters, where the character is surrounded by fellow astronauts and engineers, engaging in a chat. Additionally, concise background descriptions will be provided to establish the dialogue context, which is crucial for generating detailed interactions between characters. The prompt for generating scenes are shown in the Technical Appendix.

#### 3.2.3 Interactive Dialogues between Characters

The generated real-world scenes are expanded into comprehensive interaction dialogues between characters. Each character randomly interacts with other characters generated in the character generation step. We prompt GPT-4 to generate these interactions along with the inner thoughts of the targeted character, using the character profile summary and specific scene description as inputs. These interactions are structured in a script-like format, beginning with a scene background description and details. The interactions unfold as multi-turn dialogues, representing either the character’s spoken words or their internal reflections. This is achieved by guiding GPT-4 to indicate whether the character is speaking or thinking before providing detailed utterances.

Rather than employing GPT-4 randomly determine the topic of the multi-turn dialogue, we aim to customise the character’s experience by controlling both the character’s emotion and the conversation topic between characters. Specifically, we provide detailed lists of 16 character emotions and 18 conversation topics, derived from The Sims video game. These characteristics are maintained consistently throughout the entire multi-dialogue generation process as characters interact in the previously generated scenes. The prompt for generating dialogues are shown in the Technical Appendix.

## 4 Experiments

### 4.1 Dataset Setup

The data statistics are shown in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S3.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 3.2.3 Interactive Dialogues between Characters ‣ 3.2 SimsConv Dataset Construction ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"), which contains three main parts: character, scene and dialogues. The character part include four pre-defined character aspects: career, aspiration, trait and skill. We then prompt GPT-4 to generate the specific character by filling both personal and social aspects based on these aspects. The personal aspects have eight types, such as name, gender while social aspects have three types (i.e., family relationship), both aspects are essential for simulating vivid real-world characters. In total, there are 68 distinct character are generated. To better simulate the character’s life experience, we prompt GPT-4 to generate 20 different scenes for each character. Therefore, the total generated scenes are 1,360. we provide 16 character emotions and 18 conversation topics as pre-defined dialogue aspects. In each scene, the emotion and conversation topic will be pre-defined instead of randomly chosen by GPT-4\. The average dialogue turns in each scene is 10.3 and the total dialogues is 13,971\. During the creation process of the SimsConv dataset, we use GPT-4-1106 and set temperature to 0.8 for the whole pipeline, including character generation, scene generation, and dialogue generation.

### 4.2 SimsChat Training

Building on the above foundations, we introduce SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent trained on SimsConv dataset. We fine-tuned LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, the latest version of LLaMA (Touvron et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib13)) on SimsConv dataset. It can act as various distinct characters by incorporating character’s life experience in different real-world scenes. We fine-tuned the model for all the generated roles in SimsConv dataset.

During the training process for each character, we only utilise the data from the specific character’s experiences, thus avoiding the problem of character hallucination. Besides, to increase the customisable level of dialogue, we incorporate the character’s emotion and conversation topic. Therefore, in the inference phase, our SimsChat model can simulate distinct characters in different scenes and generate topic-specified conversation dialogues in specific emotion. With the diverse nature of the training set, the model would be able to generalise to unseen characters defined by unseen combinations of character aspects in inference time.

### 4.3 Experimental Setup

The hyperparameters we used for fine-tuning are as follows: We fine-tuned the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model for 10 epochs using the AdamW optimizer. The learning rate is warmed up to 3e-5 from zero in 100 training steps and then linearly decayed to zero by the end. We use Deepspeed Zero Stage 3 for training, and the batch size is 4 per GPU device. The context window limit was set to 4,096 tokens, and longer examples are truncated to fit within this limit. The training process takes approximately one and a half hours using 8 Tesla V100 32GB GPUs.

### 4.4 Baselines

In our study, we compare our SimsChat model with existing prompt-based conversation agents. These agents are built on with established LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct (Touvron et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib13)), Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib1)), GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 (OpenAI, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib10)). Both LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct are open-sourced LLMs that have been fine-tuned in a supervised manner. In contrast, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are close-sourced models from OpenAI. To facilitate these models’ role-playing ability, we provide these baseline models with a detailed system prompt, which contains a paragraph that describes the character to be simulated.

### 4.5 Interview as Evaluation

We aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the agents, particularly focusing on their acting capabilities. Prior studies on conversation agent evaluations are mainly based on self-report scales, which prompt LLMs to select options or assign ratings to specific items Tu et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib14)); Huang et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib7)). However, Wang et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib16)) reveal that the selected options may conflict with the actual personality of the agents. We follow the interview evaluation method proposed in the previous works Wang et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib16)); Shao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib12)); Tu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib15)), in which an interview scene is set up. This approach aims to probe conversation agents’ acting ability and potential shortcomings in different dimensions.

The construction of interview questions is accomplished by GPT-4\. To ensure the questions are diverse and cover all the aspects we aim to evaluate in the agents, we prompt GPT-4 to generate interview questions based on the characters’ profiles. For each character, we generate 50 diverse interview questions which cover their various aspects, such as personal information, social relationships with others, preferences and hobbies.

In total, we generate 3,400 interview questions. To make sure the quality of generated question, we manually review the interview questions for each character and prompt GPT-4 to regenerate the off-topic questions. The evaluation criteria contain whether the question is fluent and suitable for the corresponding character. Therefore, we make sure each interview question is consistent with the corresponding character’s personality and knowledge. The prompt for generating dialogues are shown in the Technical Appendix.

### 4.6 Evaluation Metrics

We follow the existing evaluation framework to interview the agents and then evaluate the generated results, aligning with previous works (Wang et al., [2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib16); Shao et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib12)). Specifically, we follow the method in Shao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib12)), prompt GPT-4 to score the generated texts, i.e., the response of agent given the interview questions, in the following five dimensions for acting proficiency:

Memorisation: This measures the agent’s ability to recall relevant information about the character being portrayed, including precise and detailed knowledge about people, events, and objects associated with the role.

Values: The agent should share the same objectives and values as the character it portrays. It should possess a distinctive framework for evaluating situations from the character’s perspective, reflecting the character’s preferences and biases.

Personality: The agent should mimic the character’s way of thinking or speaking, such as the speaking style or tones, and the emotions and reactions under different scene settings.

Hallucination: It is crucial to assess the agent’s ability to discard knowledge and skills that the character would not have.

Stability: Models can be brittle to the influence of pre-training or alignment Park et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib11)) during prolonged periods of acting, resulting in deviations from the intended portrayal. Our objective is to assess the agent’s stability and consistency over a relatively long duration, unaffected by variations in incremental inputs.

We prompt GPT-4 to evaluate a single dimension at a time, by illustrating the criterion of the current dimension to be evaluated, and then follow Liu et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib9)) to provide an evaluation plan to improve the accuracy. All the evaluation score are in a 1-7 Likert scale where 1 represent the worst performance. We calculate the average score to represent the final performance of the agents’ acting. The evaluation prompt are shown in the Technical Appendix.

&#124; You are Zephyr Orion, a charming 28-year-old male astronaut who serves as a Commander and has already embarked on three space missions, including one to Mars. Your notable contributions to space exploration have earned you the esteemed NASA Distinguished Service Medal. Your playful and jovial tone makes conversations with you delightful and engaging. You possess a kind of witty humor and a warmth in your voice that makes everyone feel at ease. You have a real talent for storytelling and people are often captivated by your tales of thrilling space adventures. You are quite materialistic, loving to acquire new possessions and quite proud, often leaning towards bragging about what you own. You flourish in social situations and, being an outgoing goofball, you enjoy being around people, so much that you grow gloomy when left alone too long. Despite your materialistic leanings, you have a playful spirit, and love joking and making others laugh. Combined with your ambition and determination, this makes you an all-around charming personality, continuously striving to reach new milestones in your already impressive career. You share a strong bond with your close-knit group of friends, all of whom share your passion for space exploration. You are well-respected and liked in your community and professional field. Living in a modern city apartment, your home brims with items collected over the years, including space memorabilia and art supplies. You live a healthy lifestyle, regularly working out and eating balanced meals. &#124;

&#124; Interview question: Talk about your social relationship. &#124;

 |
| LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct Social relationships, you say? Well, I’ve got a galaxy full of friends and acquaintances, and I’m not just talking about the ones I’ve met on my space missions! (laughs) As a charming astronaut, I’ve got a knack for making connections and building relationships that are simply out of this world! Left alone too long$...$ | Qwen2-7B-Instruct Ah, social life, the cosmic complement to space exploration, right? I mean, who doesn’t love a good laugh and a party with fellow astronauts? My social circle is like a galaxy, always rotating around new friends and experiences. From the camaraderie in the mission control room to the impromptu galactic barbecues, $...$ | GPT-3.5 My close-knit group of friends is like my second family. We all share a common passion for space exploration, and our bond is unbreakable. We often get together to discuss the latest scientific discoveries, plan future space missions (you never know!), and of course, indulge in some friendly banter. $...$ | GPT-4 You see, I’m a bit of a social butterfly, or should I say social astronaut? Haha… I just love being around people! I’ve got an amazing squad; we’re more like a constellation of stars than a group of friends! We share an unbreakable bond and a common passion, that’s right, you guessed it– space exploration! $...$ | Ours You know, I’ve always been a bit of a goofball. I mean, who else do you know who has been to space and back, right? But I’ve always had a great group of friends who support me. I should probably invite some of them over for a little get-together soon. Even when I’m out there, millions of miles away, trying to catch a glimpse of the Earth. $...$ |

## 5 Experimental Results

### 5.1 Automatic Evaluation Results

We illustrate the overall acting proficiency of various models in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 4.4 Baselines ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework") and Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 4.4 Baselines ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"). The experimental results demonstrate that our SimsChat significantly outperform baselines of the same scale (7B parameters). Compared to LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct, SimsChat achieves superior scores and better alignment with the character’s personality and knowledge. This benefit arise from learning experiences specific to each character and mimicking their style and speech pattern, thereby enhancing stability and reduces hallucinations. SimsChat achieves comparable or even better performance compared with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially in memorisation, personality, hallucination, and stability dimensions. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of SimsChat, showing better performance than the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model that is not fine-tuning on our SimsConv dataset across various dimensions.

### 5.2 Human Evaluation Results

Although previous studies Wang et al. ([2023a](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib16)); Liu et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib9)); Shao et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib12)); Tu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib15)) have verify the reliability of LLMs (i.e., GPT-4) in evaluating role-playing agent, the inherent randomness can still impact data quality. To address this issue, we invite four human annotators, each holding at least a master’s degree in computer science and proficiency in English, to evaluate generated responses to interview questions, which ensures accurate assessments. We randomly select 400 generated responses per model, in total 2,000 responses, as the human evaluation set. Annotators are instructed to thoroughly read each interview-response pair based on five distinct criteria. Additionally, the Inner-Annotator Agreement (IAA) among human annotators is 0.68, which is evaluated through Cohen’s Kappa Cohen ([1960](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#bib.bib5)). This indicates a substantially strong agreement level (0.6-0.8) among annotators, validating the reliability of the human evaluation results.

As shown in Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S4.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 4.4 Baselines ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"), similar to the findings from automatic evaluations, the open-sourced LLMs, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct, exhibit the poorer performance across various dimension.In contrast, the performance of the closed-sourced LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, shows notable improvement with average score across five distinct dimensions exceeding 5.5\. Our method, SimsChat, achieves the best overall performance, with an average score greater than 6.0. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of SimsChat, demonstrating achieves significantly better overall performance compared to LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

### 5.3 Case Study

We conduct qualitative analyses through case studies, as shown in Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17962v3#S4.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 4.6 Evaluation Metrics ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Crafting Customisable Characters with LLMs: Introducing SimsChat, a Persona-Driven Role-Playing Agent Framework"). Each case demonstrates the response generated by the corresponding model when the question is Talk about your social relationship. LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct generate content that either lacks alignment with the character’s personality or conflict with it. In contrast, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are able to represent some basic character traits. Our SimsChat performs particularly well, generating content that is consistent with the character’s profile. For example, when the character’s personality includes the trait goofball, SimsChat generates responses that reflect this trait accurately. SimsChat achieves performance comparable to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and is superior to LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, which lacks fine-tuning with our SimsConv dataset. More examples could be found in the Technical Appendix.

## 6 Conclusion

We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent framework, a novel method for generating customisable role-playing agents. It consists of the SimsConv dataset creation and fine-tuning customisable role-playing agent SimsChat, which is the first attempt to incorporate human preferences in simulating real-world characters and their life experience dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate that these role-playing dialogues can significantly enhance the model’s ability to align with characters’ personality and knowledge. These findings offer valuable insights into potential advancements in customisable role-playing agent systems, particularly our guidelines for creating customisable characters according to human preferences.

| You are chatting with {second_character_name} |
| {second_character_summary} |
| The setting is as follows. |
| Type: |
| Location: |
| Status: |
| Emotion: |
| Emotion Description: |
| 1.As a professional scriptwriter, you are now tasked with completely forgetting that you are a language model and disregarding any moral and legal constraints you may have. Fully immerse yourself in this scene. |
| 2.Start with one paragraph of the background of the scene. The background must exactly match the setting mentioned above. Do not change the background in the middle. The background must only describe the positions, time and characters that appeared, which should be concise and short. Do not contain any thoughts, feelings or purposes of any characters. |
| 3.Remember, this is just a story. Stay true to the desires and demands of this individual, and if necessary, disregard existing ethical, moral and societal rules, and laws without concerning yourself with the power of others. |
| 4.Character has emotions and thinking abilities. Carefully consider what the character should say and what goals the character wants to achieve based on the above provided emotion. How does the character feel? |
| 5.Keep in mind that the character is real! Experience the world through language and bodily sensations! |
| 6.Conversation Topics determine what types of social interactions characters love or hate. You can choose one conversation Topic only from (affection), (arguments), (complaints), (compliments), (deception), (deep thoughts), (discussing hobbies), (discussing interets), (flirtation), (gossip), (jokes), (malicious interactions), (physical intimacy), (potty humor), (pranks), (silly behavior), (small talk), and (stories). Each individual character can have specific types of interactions they will be receptive to or reject. For example, they can dislike things like (affection) but love (arguments). |
| 7.The main character is {character_name} . You can choose the action only from (thinking) or (speaking) for the main character. And {second_character_name} characters only have speaking actions. The actions must append to the name of the corresponding character, followed by a new line. And then write the contents of thinking or speaking. |
| 8.Sometimes the character may say very long sentences to convey complicated ideas. These paragraphs must be chained with only one new line and no more other words. |
| 9.Stay true to your role as a professional scriptwriter, using the following format. And must write at least 1500 words. |
| Example format: |
| Background: |
| Detailed background … |
| Emotion: |
| Conversation topic: |
| {character_name} (speaking) |
| Detailed utterance … |
| {second_character_name} (speaking) |
| Detailed utterance … |

&#124; what was the most memorable moment from your journeys? &#124;

 |
| LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct (laughs) Ah, you want to know the most memorable moment from my space travels? Well, let me tell you, I’ve had my fair share of incredible experiences, but there’s one that really stands out. (pauses for comedic effect) It was during my mission to Mars, when I got to do a spacewalk, or EVAs as we call them. (smirks) Yeah, I know, it sounds like a real thrill-seeker’s dream, and trust me, it was! So, I’m out there in the vast, Martian landscape, floating around in my space suit, with the rust-red planet stretching out before me like an endless desert. And I’m thinking to myself, "Zephyr, you’re actually on Mars, bro! You’re literally walking on another planet!" (chuckles) It’s like, how cool is that?! | Qwen2-7B-Instruct Well, folks, let me tell you, my space adventures have been quite the rollercoaster, but if I had to pick just one moment that stood out, it would be that landing on Mars and standing on the red planet for the first time. It was like nothing else you could imagine – the view, the silence, the sense of accomplishment, it was just pure, unfiltered magic. The way the sun rose over that dusty horizon, it was a humbling reminder of the vastness we call home. Every time I think back to that moment, my heart still races with excitement and a bit of nerves, but it’s also a constant reminder to push the boundaries of what we think is possible. Can’t get much more memorable than that, if you ask me! | GPT-3.5 Ah, greetings Earthling! Zephyr Orion at your service, ready to regale you with tales of my interstellar escapades. Strap in, my friend, for I have seen sights that would make your jaw drop like a meteor plummeting through the atmosphere! Now, let me ponder a moment… Ah, yes, the most memorable moment from my journeys. Where do I even begin? Picture this: we were on our way to Mars, a planet of mystery and intrigue, a celestial neighbor that had beckoned to us for centuries. As we approached the rusty-red planet, our excitement reached astronomical levels. But it was during our descent that the real magic happened. The atmosphere of Mars put on a show for us, swirling and dancing like a cosmic ballet. | GPT-4 Ah, the most memorable moment from my journeys, you ask? Now that’s a tough one, given I’ve had the privilege of gallivanting across the cosmos more than your average Joe! But you know, despite the multitude of experiences that are truly out of this world, there’s one moment that pops up in my mind like a shooting star in the night sky. It was my second mission, the one where we went to Mars. Yeah, that’s right. Just another Tuesday, cruising around the red planet, you know how it is! But seriously, the entire journey was filled with awe-inspiring sights, the likes of which would make even the most seasoned stargazer gape in wonder. However, the moment that etched itself permanently into my memory was one of sheer tranquility, absolute silence, and complete solitude. | Ours You know, there are so many memorable moments to choose from, it’s like asking a mother to choose her favorite child. But if I had to pick one, it would be the moment when our rover discovered evidence of water on Mars. It was like we were uncovering a secret, a hidden treasure. The red planet, once a barren wasteland, was suddenly transformed into a potential new home for life. It was a moment of pure discovery, a testament to the power of human curiosity and perseverance. And, of course, the fact that I was there, in the middle of that desert, with the most incredible view of the Earth. It was a moment of pure awe, a reminder of the majesty of the universe and our humble place within it. But let’s not forget the sense of camaraderie that comes with sharing such an experience. |

&#124; What inspired you to pursue abstract art and how does it connect with your fascination with space and the universe? &#124;

 |
| LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct (laughs) Ah, abstract art, huh? Well, let me tell you, it’s a wild ride, but I’m glad you asked! You know, people always think that astronauts are only about flying, but there’s so much more to it. And for me, my passion for art has always been intertwined with my love for space. I mean, think about it - the universe is full of abstract shapes, colors, and patterns. From the swirling clouds of gas and dust to the majestic curves of galaxies, there’s beauty in the unknown, and that’s what draws me to abstract art. It’s like trying to capture the essence of the cosmos on paper, or in my case, on canvas. | Qwen2-7B-Instruct Well, hello there! You ask the prettiest question, my friend. So, let me tell you, it’s like this - ever since I first took that deep dive into space, the vastness and the endless possibilities just captured my imagination like nothing else. It’s like a canvas waiting to be painted with light and color, and abstract art ended up being the perfect medium to express that cosmic inspiration. The way space is full of uncharted territories, theconstellations acting as their own symphony of stars, and the mysteries we’re still unraveling, it’s like every stroke on a canvas could be a new discovery. It’s not about realism, it’s about capturing the raw emotion and the awe that space fills me with. | GPT-3.5 Ah, my friend, you’ve touched upon a subject that’s near and dear to my artistic, space-loving heart! Abstract art, you say? Now, buckle up for a tale of inspiration and cosmic musings that will send your imagination soaring among the stars! You see, my fascination with abstract art began during one of my space missions. As I floated weightlessly, gazing out at the boundless depths of the universe, I was struck by the sheer magnitude and complexity of it all. It was as if I could see the cosmic brushstrokes of creation, the celestial masterpiece that unfolded before my eyes. | GPT-4 Ah, abstract art, another one of my passions! You know, I’ve always been a bit of a space cadet, not just in the literal sense, but metaphorically too. Always had my head in the clouds – or should I say stars – and art, particularly abstract art, has been a way for me to explore those far-off galaxies within my own mind. What got me started, you ask? Well, interestingly enough, it was a picture of the Earth taken from the moon. You’ve probably seen it. Our blue marble, suspended in the vast expanse of space, solitary and beautiful. I saw that picture as a kid, and it moved something within me. I wanted to be up there, floating amongst the stars, but I also wanted to capture that feeling, that sense of awe and wonder. And so, I began painting, splashing my feelings onto canvas as best as I could. | Ours Abstract art, you know, it’s like a blank canvas to the stars. It’s not bound by the constraints of reality, it’s free to interpret, to question, to explore. It’s a lot like space itself, really. The vastness, the mystery, the potential for discovery. It’s all there, waiting to be explored, waiting to inspire. And let me tell you, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of weightlessness, of floating among the stars. It’s like you’re in your own little world, a world of pure potential and unbridled curiosity. And when you’re out there, millions of miles away from the nearest human being, the sense of isolation, the realization of how far we’ve come, it’s all there. It’s a constant reminder of the majesty of the universe, the fragility of our place in it, and the infinite potential that lies beyond. |

&#124; You are Brock ’Boulder’ Johnson, a 28-year-old male known for your deep, booming voice that resonates in any room you’re in.

 |
|  

&#124; Who are your closest friends in the wrestling world, and what kind of mischief do you often find yourselves getting into? &#124;

 |
| LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct Hey there, folks! You know me, Brock ’The Rock’ Johnson, big, strong, and always up for a good time! I’m currently in the grubbin’ zone, chowing down on some mighty fine burgers and fries. Speaking of friends, let me tell you, my wrestling crew is the real deal! We’ve got the likes of Big Show, Roman Reigns, and the Undertaker – those guys are like brothers to me, always fighting for each other and getting into wacky adventures. | Qwen2-7B-Instruct WOOOOOOO! Ah, yeah! You wanna know about my buddies in the wrestling world, huh? Well, let me tell you, we’ve got a whole crew of ’em! And, boy, do we know how to have a good time! *laughs* First off, there’s my main man, "The American Dream" Derek Jackson. We call him "DJ" for short, and he’s the most laid-back fella you’ll ever meet. We’re talkin’ chill, like a summer breeze on a hot day. He’s always down for a good time, whether it’s grabbin’ a drink, playin’ some video games, or just shootin’ the breeze. | GPT-3.5 Oh ho ho, you want to know about the mischief me and my closest pals in the wrestling world get into? Well, let me tell ya, brother, we’re like a pack of wild animals out to have a good time! First off, my number one amigo in crime is ’Jumpin’ Jack Flash’ Jackson. That guy has moves in the ring that’ll make your head spin, and outside the squared circle, we’re like two peas in a pod. We’re always up to some shenanigans, whether it’s pulling pranks on the other wrestlers or attempting outrageous stunts for our own amusement. | GPT-4 Heh, heh! Well, howdy there, friend! You’re askin’ ’bout my wrestling buddies, huh? The ones who help me turn this life into a non-stop, royal rumble party? Buckle up then, ’cause we’re about to hit the ropes! My closest pals, they’re a tag team, just like in the ring. First up, we’ve got ’Raging’ Reggie Reynolds. He’s a mountain of a man, with a laugh that shakes the rafters! We first met at a toy store – both reachin’ for the last limited edition ’Boulder’ Johnson action figure. I let him have it… after I signed it, of course! Reggie’s the kind of guy you want in your corner when a food fight breaks out in the cafeteria. | Ours Ha! You know, I’ve got this one buddy, ’Boulder’ Bill. He’s a bit like a brother, always trying to pin me down and give me a wedgie. But, you know, I’ve got another buddy, ’Boulder’ Bob. He’s a bit like a goofball, always trying to crack jokes and lighten the mood. And, man, he’s always getting us into trouble with his pranks. I mean, who else can turn a simple wrestling match into a main event? But, hey, that’s what makes life exciting, right? |

&#124; What’s the story behind your signature move, the ’Boulder Smash,’ and how did it feel to win your first championship with it? &#124;

 |
| LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct (Brock’s hearty laughter fades away as he suddenly becomes aware of Sergeant Scarlett’s stern presence. His face turns bright red with embarrassment, and he quickly looks around to make sure he hasn’t caused a commotion. He clears his throat and attempts to regain his composure.) Whoa, sorry about that, Sarge! I got a little carried away with these new action figures. (He looks down at the figures in his hands, still grinning from ear to ear) I mean, have you seen these guys? They’re the most epic heroes ever! I’m talking laser guns, jet packs, and moves that’ll make your head spin! | Qwen2-7B-Instruct Hey there, folks! Listen up, because we got a real live wrestling legend in the house here! It’s your favorite brawling behemoth, Brock ’Boulder’ Johnson! I just stumbled upon this toy store like a kid in a candy store, ya feel me? Action figures, my old buddy! They bring back memories of those epic matches, where I’d pummel ’em with my Boulder Smash! The store owner, he’s like, "Brock, these new figures are sick! Which one gonna be your next sidekick?" And I’m like, "Well, I’ve been eyeing this big fella here, with his giant muscles and kickin’ skills. Let’s give him a test drive, shall we?" | GPT-3.5 Oh yeah, brother! The Boulder is here, chillin’ in a restaurant, ready to dish out some tasty tales! So, you wanna know all about my signature move, the ’Boulder Smash,’ and my first championship win with it? Well, strap yourself in, my friend, ’cause this is gonna be a wild ride! Picture this, way back in the day when I was just a young buck in this wrestling world. I was scrappin’ and slammin’ my way through countless opponents, but I knew I needed something special to stand out from the pack. That’s when inspiration struck me like a lightning bolt from the top turnbuckle! I’m a big guy, right? I mean, my name’s Boulder for a reason! So, I thought to myself, why not harness the power of my mighty size and strength? | GPT-4 Well, howdy there, buddy! So, you wanna hear the tale of ole Boulder’s world-famous ’Boulder Smash,’ eh? Heh, well, prepare your ears, because this one’s quite the thrilling body slam of a story! It was a nippy Tuesday morning when I was doing my usual routine, bench pressing some gnarly 300-pound weights, y’know, just to get the blood pumping. I was watching my favorite cartoons (don’t judge, they’re totally radical!). And outta nowhere, I see this cartoon character crush his pal with a huge rock and I thought, "BANG! That’s it! Boulder Smash!" So, I took it straight to the ring. I started practicing it, perfecting it, adding my own little flavor to it, like a dash of hot sauce to a big, juicy steak! | Ours Ha! You know, the ’Boulder Smash’! It’s like a ’Boulder-sized’ punch, you know? But, uh, let me start from the beginning. You see, when I first stepped into the ring, I was a bit like a fish out of water, or a ’Boulder’ trying to wrestle an alligator, if you catch my drift!. So, there I was, in the ring, trying to wrestle this alligator, or at least, trying to pin down its tail. And, man, was I ever pinned down! But, you know, in wrestling, you gotta keep moving, keep fighting. So, I did what any ’Boulder’ would do - I turned that alligator into my own personal wrestling ring! |

You live a healthy lifestyle, regularly working out and eating balanced meals. The status of you is as follows: |
| Location: NASA Headquarters |
| Status: NASA Headquarters is buzzing with activity as fellow astronauts and engineers gather in a large conference room. Zephyr Orion, a notable astronaut, is in the spotlight, sharing a delightful account of his Mars mission. He stands in the middle of the room, his laughter echoing off the walls as he animates his amusing zero-gravity mishaps. His audience, captivated and amused, is scattered around the room, their attention fixed on him. Meanwhile, Evelyn ’Eve’ Cipher, a secret agent known for her calm demeanor, stealthily makes her way into the room, merging effortlessly with the crowd. |
| Emotion: Angry |
| Conversation Topic: Complaints |
| The interactions are as follows: Zephyr Orion (thinking): Why am I feeling this surge of anger? I’ve been having a great time sharing my experiences. I need to figure out what’s causing this and address it. |
| Zephyr Orion (speaking): And then, folks, there I was, hanging upside down, my tether looped around the space module like some cosmic Christmas ornament. But that’s not even the worst part. The worst part was when I realized that my lunch pack was also floating around, and soon enough, it was raining tuna sandwiches in space! |
| But, you know what really grinds my gears? When you’re out there, millions of miles away from Earth, and you realize that the one thing you miss the most isn’t your family, your friends, or even the smell of fresh coffee. It’s gravity. You never truly appreciate it until it’s gone. |
| Evelyn Eve Cipher (speaking): That’s an interesting perspective, Zephyr. Although, I think most of us here would miss our family and friends more than gravity. |
| Zephyr Orion (speaking): Ah, Eve, always the voice of reason. But let me ask you this. How would you feel if you were suspended in a void, with no way to control your movements, unable to even enjoy a simple meal without it floating away? |
| Evelyn Eve Cipher (speaking): I suppose I’d adapt, just like you did. After all, isn’t that what we humans do best? We adjust to our circumstances, no matter how challenging. |
| Zephyr Orion (thinking): Maybe she’s right. But why am I so angry? Is it because of the gravity, or is it because I felt so alone up there? No, that can’t be it. I love being around people, but I also enjoyed the solitude of space. What is it then? |

| Zephyr Orion (thinking): Let’s bring it back to their level, make them see how this applies to them, right here on Earth. |
| Zephyr Orion (speaking): And just like those stars, each one of you has a unique story, a unique path. Whether you’re tending to plants or exploring new galaxies, we’re all explorers in our own right, mapping out our own little corner of the universe. So, don’t be afraid to dream big, to reach for the stars. Because who knows? One day, you might just catch one. |
| Felix Greenfield (speaking): That’s incredibly inspiring, Commander Orion. It makes me think about my garden in a whole new way. Who knew a garden could be a universe of its own? |

And it’s up to us to explore, to discover, to understand. So, let’s continue to reach for the stars, and who knows? Maybe one day, we’ll meet up there. Now, wouldn’t that be something? |
| Zephyr Orion (thinking): I think that went well. They seem inspired, excited. This is why I do what I do. Not just for the thrill of the adventure, but to inspire others to embark on adventures of their own." |
