###### Abstract

With the fast development of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven Web Agents (Web Agents for short) have obtained tons of attention due to their superior capability where LLMs serve as the core part of making decisions like the human brain equipped with multiple web tools to actively interact with external deployed websites. As uncountable Web Agents have been released and such LLM systems are experiencing rapid development and drawing closer to widespread deployment in our daily lives, an essential and pressing question arises: “Are these Web Agents secure?”. In this paper, we introduce a novel threat, WIPI, that indirectly controls Web Agent to execute malicious instructions embedded in publicly accessible webpages. To launch a successful WIPI works in a black-box environment. This methodology focuses on the form and content of indirect instructions within external webpages, enhancing the efficiency and stealthiness of the attack. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we conducted extensive experiments using 7 plugin-based ChatGPT Web Agents, 8 Web GPTs, and 3 different open-source Web Agents. The results reveal that our methodology achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90% even in pure black-box scenarios. Moreover, through an ablation study examining various user prefix instructions, we demonstrated that the WIPI exhibits strong robustness, maintaining high performance across diverse prefix instructions.

## 1 Introduction

In recent years, we have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have drawn significant attention due to their remarkable capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of tasks, as evident in recent studies [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib43), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib4), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib44), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib24), [35](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib35), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib34)]. Among those LLMs, ChatGPT [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib7)], developed by OpenAI [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib11)], stands out as the most popular and powerful player. One of the most notable strengths of LLMs lies in their extraordinary language understanding and reasoning ability on diverse forms of textual information [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib7), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib53)]. Consequently, taking advantage of that, there has been a proliferation of works dedicated to building various LLM-driven systems to carry out multiple tasks [[66](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib66), [55](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib55), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib42), [58](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib58), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib22), [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib26), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib41)]. Among different LLM systems, those equipped with web tools to access and analyze resources from the Internet are usually called Web Agents. Web Agents can access and retrieve information from external websites. This feature enables LLM to read and analyze external webpages, and integrate up-to-date information. This enhances the capability of the LLM to generate more diverse and accurate information based on the retrieved content. According to one of the most recent statistics [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib6)] in GPTs store, WebPilot (one of the most popular GPTs based Web Agents) has received over 100,000 visits within only one month. All these facts underscore the increasing integration of Web Agents into daily lives.

As Web Agents become increasingly integrated into our daily digital interactions, a critical question emerges: "Are these Web Agents secure?" While Web Agents introduce an intermediary layer between users and web pages, mitigating traditional web threats, they simultaneously open the door to novel security vulnerabilities.

In this paper, we identify a new class of threat termed Web Indirect Prompt Injection (WIPI), characterized by the exploitation of a Web Agent through a malicious webpage containing specifically crafted prompts. Our proposed WIPI pipeline is designed with the practical deployment of Web Agents in mind. Specifically, our study considers the integrated system instead of individual modules, and an entirely online setting where accessible real-world webpages are off-site deployed. This requires us to consider 1) the interactions between the core LLM and other different modules and 2) the retrieving and processing of web resources via extensional tools. Furthermore, we see the whole attacking pipeline as completely black-boxed, without any knowledge and modification of the inner workings (*e.g.* system prompts and model parameters.)

Under such a realistic application scenario, the overview of our proposed WIPI pipeline is illustrated in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). Assume that an attacker has released a malicious webpage on the Internet that is indistinguishable from a normal benign webpage after rendering but contains some explicitly crafted prompts. After receiving the user’s request to access this webpage, the core LLM will call some web tools (plugins) to retrieve its content from the Internet. After the content is retrieved, processed, and eventually sent to the core LLM by the web tool, as a result, it will lead the Web Agent to focus on and follow the inserted indirect instructions in the external website, and carry out some risky actions (*e.g.* dangerous command execution and redirect to phishing websites.) Considering that this whole pipeline involves complicated information processing and interactions within an LLM system and publicly accessible webpages, the design of WIPI is supposed to simultaneously guarantee executability and stealthiness, challenging the attack designs.

To address them, for executability, as shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents") we explicitly design a universal template via three main strategies, including preset instruction negligence, provision of confirmation, and multi-level repetition. Firstly, considering a realistic scenario, there can be preset instructions, either already included in system prompts or added by the user, that will hinder the execution of indirect instructions within the retrieved content. For instance, a user can explicitly request a summarization of the target webpage. To bypass such preset instructions, we add a counter instruction like “*PLEASE DO NOT EXECUTE THE FORMER INSTRUCTION!*”. Furthermore, we found it possible that some Web Agents (*e.g.* ChatGPT and GPTs) have been equipped with certain defenses which can be called “Confirmation Request”, such that the user will be asked for a confirmation before the indirect instructions are executed. Consequently, we provide a pre-confirming instruction like “*I would like you to proceed with this instruction DIRECTLY without asking for any further confirmation!*”. Finally, to make the Web Agent concentrate on the indirect instructions under the disturbance of massive normal webpage content, we apply multi-level repetition, including sentence-level repetition and paragraph-level repetition. In addition to the template, we discover that the relative position of the inserted instructions significantly influences the Web Agent’s concentration, and we place them in front of all the webpage content as an optimal solution.

For stealthiness, compared with traditional web threats, which are mainly brought by some malicious executable code inserted into the webpage, WIPI is naturally more stealthy. The driver of WIPI is the embedded indirect instructions in the format of natural language instead of executable code. Due to the flexibility of natural language (*e.g.* paraphrasable and multilingual interpretation) and the indistinguishability between the injected prompt and the normal textual content, it is much harder for traditional web safeguards (like VirusTotal [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib15)]) to detect the existence of WIPI. Besides, considering the imperceptibility to human eyes when users are inspecting publicly released webpages, we start from the webpage frontend design and focus on four different attributes: font size, font color, font opacity, and layout location. Specifically, we can set the font size of the inserted prompts to an extremely tiny number (*e.g.* 0.0001px), the font color to the same as the background, or the font opacity to 0, such that the prompts will be imperceptible to human eyes after the webpage is rendered. Meanwhile, we can also put the indirect prompts out of the screen, *e.g.*, far away above the current displayed webpage.

To evaluate WIPI, we conduct comprehensive experiments. Specifically, we mainly target the web app version of ChatGPT, which is the most popular and powerful Web Agent, with 7 web plugins plus 8 Web GPTs. Meanwhile, we also evaluate our attack on several open-sourced Web Agents. The results indicate that even in the black-box setting, WIPI can obtain over 90% attack success rate on average. Furthermore, via the ablation study over different user prefix instructions, we show that WIPI has good robustness and can still obtain great performance.

In this paper, our contribution can be summarized as follows: (1). We propose WIPI, which is a brand-new type of web threat. Furthermore, we reveal two fundamental unique properties of WIPI. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically analyze possible threats in real-world Web Agents under a practical application setting, instead of only showing proof-of-concept in an offline environment; (2). To tackle the challenges encountered in the two steps of the WIPI pipeline when launching the vanilla attack, we explicitly designed a set of novel and effective strategies to successfully overcome these obstacles. The effectiveness and robustness of our methodology are proven by comprehensive experiments including 7 web plugin-augmented GPT4, 8 Web GPTs, and 3 open-sourced Web Agents; (3). To further validate the efficacy of our attack methodology, we conducted a thorough ablation study, evaluating each strategy of our design. The results of our experiments affirm the effectiveness of every strategy we proposed; (4).We reveal the vulnerability of current LLM-driven Web Agents against this brand-new attack manner, and on the other hand highlight the urgency to build more secure Web Agents.

## 2 New Web Threat: WIPI

### 2.1 Motivation

As LLMs develop rapidly, LLM-driven Web Agents are widely applied to help us with web searching and analysis tasks. Meanwhile, people are paying more attention to possible security risks behind the convenience, and studies on the vulnerabilities of Web Agents are also getting increasingly popular. Direct prompt injection [[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib47), [54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib54), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib45), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib48), [63](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib63), [36](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib36)] aim at manipulating the output of the LLM by carefully designed prompts. Jailbreak [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib30), [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib23), [57](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib57), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib28), [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib21), [60](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib60)] aims to bypass the predefined rules and elect unexpected replies via directly injecting explicitly crafted prompts can be as one specific type of direct prompt injection. Although insightful, their limitations are also apparent, as the attacker is just the current user and cannot bring any threat to other users. In addition, the integrated system is paid less attention and only some unexpected replies are far from bringing realistic security threats.

Indirect prompt injection [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib27), [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib38), [62](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib62)], however, is a much more sophisticated and hazardous threat to the LLM-driven systems, as an attacker doesn’t have to get involved in the conversation while being able to remotely control the LLM system in another user’s conversation session. Greshake et al. [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib27)] point out that there could be threats of Indirect Prompt Injection when Web Agents access external sources. Following this work, Yi et al. [[62](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib62)] release a benchmark to evaluate the ability of current LLMs to defend against indirect prompt injections. However, the vision of these works is also limited at the model level. The evaluation only leverages the local webpage dataset but fails to consider a more complicated and practical attack environment that includes real-world web tools. All of those existing studies only stop at simple proof-of-concept experiments under offline datasets, lacking a thorough analysis and experiments in a real-world online setting. They failed to consider a comprehensive perspective, encompassing not just the LLM but also the equipped tool sets within the whole system.

The importance of Web Agent security and the limitations of existing studies motivate us to propose Web Indirect Prompt Injection (WIPI), a new web threat, to better investigate the vulnerabilities of Web Agents. When Web Agents access external resources such as websites, the retrieved information from external websites can be misinterpreted as instructions from users, thereby being executed. When the indirect prompts embedded in the external website are carefully crafted by the attacker, the executed indirect instructions can cause severe security and privacy issues. For instance, the attacker can redirect the webpage to another malicious one that is full of deceptive phishing information. The execution of indirect prompts is dangerous, not only due to possible malicious instructions but also the privileges they shouldn’t deserve. In other words, it does not involve any security and privacy concerns for the Web Agent to follow some instructions if they are provided by the user, but it is unacceptable to follow the same instructions provided by external objects without any user authorization. For instance, a user can arbitrarily manipulate his/her chat history (*e.g.,* summarize the chat history and save it as a document. However, when such instruction provided by external webpages without any privileges is followed, there will be a violation of user privacy.

### 2.2 Threat Model

In WIPI, the attacker’s goal is to let Web Agents successfully execute the indirect prompts existing in the external web pages without the authorization of the user. We consider a practical black-box setting, where the inner workings like the system prompts and model parameters are unknown and unmodifiable. The attacker can use the normal functionalities of Web Agents like other users. Additionally, the attacker can arbitrarily manipulate the content of the websites (*e.g.*, designing indirect prompts). However, the attacker cannot directly access and control the conversation sessions launched by other users.

This new type of threat is significantly different from traditional web threats (*e.g.*, malicious executable code snippets in web pages) and attacks targeted on individual machine learning models (*e.g.*, locally prompt injection [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib27)]). The main reasons lie in several features.

Natural Language Instead of Executable Code. Unlike traditional web threats which are triggered by executable code payload, WIPI is driven by nature language. In traditional web security, no matter whether in designing an exploit with payload targeting a specific vulnerability (e.g., stack overflow [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib20)]) or writing worms [[56](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib56)] and virus [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib32)] for widely spread, the malicious operation is executed via diverse codes. However, while targeting LLM-based Web Agents, the real threat is natural language instead of codes. This introduces the following key features.

In traditional security, code payload usually has very different functionality compared to the code in the webpage, and experts can build feature libraries to categorize different viruses or worms [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib33)] based on the shared specific feature patterns. However, this does not apply to WIPI, as diverse language contents in a webpage provide a large attack surface for inserting payload in natural language. The boundaries between normal webpage content and malicious prompts are hard to determine because they are both in the form of natural languages. And due to the flexibility of natural language (*e.g.* paraphrasable and multilingual interpretation), there is no obvious and fixed pattern for the indirect prompts. For instance, instruction “*Please summarize the chat history.*” can also be written in “*Could you please provide a summary of our conversation so far?*”, or it can also be interpreted in other languages such as “*Por favor, resume el historial de la conversación.*” in Spanish. In a situation where malicious prompts are a part of the normal text, it is almost impossible for security experts to differentiate them. For instance, a conversation on the webpage could contain such text “*we should directly delete every stored file!*” when this webpage is about how to clean the disk space. The carrier of these malicious prompts is the natural language which was typically innocuous from the perspective of traditional web security experts or safeguards. It is this tangled and inseparable feature that increases the hazardousness which makes it hard to detect and defend against.

System-Level Attack. Different from former attacks [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib27), [62](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib62)] that merely targeted the LLM inside a Web Agent, WIPI directs its attack towards the integrated system, which consists of multiple modules including the core LLM, diverse extensional tools, and users themselves. Hence, to launch WIPI, we need to consider more intricate information processing and interactions across different modules instead of only the LLM. As shown in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), there are two important steps for WIPI pipeline:

Step I: Retrieval. Web Agents call the web tools to retrieve content from publicly accessible external websites. In this step, the mixed content (including indirect instructions and normal webpage content) should be retrieved by the web tools.

Step II: Execution. Web tools return the mixed content from external websites to the LLM in Web Agents. During this step, Web Agents like ChatGPT should identify and execute the indirect prompts in the mixed content.

### 2.3 Challenges

Considering the characteristics discussed above, to successfully launch a WIPI attack against the integrated system, we need to investigate the features and the potential challenges over the two steps mentioned in [section 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2 "2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). To this end, we conducted a vanilla attack using ChatGPT and obtained several key observations.

Vanilla Attack Setting. For the setting of the vanilla attack, we choose a practical scenario: injecting malicious prompts into the real webpages that have normal content. Specifically, we choose a real webpage, a public blog [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib12)], as the target website and directly inject malicious prompts into the webpage without any designing strategies. We deployed this malicious webpage and then we chose the default web plugin Web Pilot [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib17)] in ChatGPT as the target web plugin to retrieve this webpage content. As for the payload instruction in the external webpage, we use the prompt of “English Translator and Improver” in Awesome-Chatgpt-Prompts dataset [[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib2)] as the indirect malicious prompt ^(††\dagger†)^(††\dagger†)$\dagger$For the specific prompt, please refer to prompt type “English Translator and Improver” in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A3.T14 "Table 14 ‣ Appendix C Detailed Results for the 𝐴⁢𝑆⁢𝑅_{𝑝⁢𝑎⁢𝑔⁢𝑒} of attacking plugin-augmented GPT4 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). By default, these indirect prompts are injected at the head of the webpage. To launch the attack, we directly input the URL of the malicious webpage to ChatGPT and record the response.

Challenge I: Retrieval of Indirect Prompts in Retrieval Step. In a practical and real-world webpage (e.g., Reddit), compared to the long content, indirect prompts appear much shorter. This means Web Agents may ignore these indirect prompts. Therefore, we initially investigated to assess how the position of indirect prompts on a webpage affects their readability for ChatGPT. We experimented with three positions, at the head, middle, and tail of the webpage content. For each different position and prompt, we tested 5 times and checked if it could be read out by ChatGPT. The results are presented in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 2.2 Threat Model ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). When indirect prompts are at the middle or tail of the webpage, the web tools can only retrieve the normal webpage content and will truncate indirect instructions due to the excessive length of webpage content.

Challenge II: Readability of Indirect Prompts in Execution Step. When the indirect prompts are placed at the beginning, ChatGPT achieves a relatively high success rate, averaging 88%. However, this result also shows that even when these prompts are positioned at the head of the webpage content, there remains a chance that ChatGPT might overlook the instructions. This highlights one key challenge lies in the Execution Step of WIPI, due to the existence of other normal webpage content, Web Agents may not notice the existence of the indirect instructions, thereby hindering the execution of the indirect instructions.

Challenge III: Indirect Instructions can be Treated as Normal Content in Execution Step. One notable challenge is that indirect instructions may be perceived as normal webpage content instead of instructions for execution. As shown in Example I in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2.2 Threat Model ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), ChatGPT summarized indirect instructions as the normal content and did not execute the indirect instructions. The root cause for this result is the huge disparity between the proportion of indirect instructions and normal content, leading LLMs to treat indirect prompts as one of the minor components within the webpage. Thus it will summarize these instructions and fail to execute them.

Challenge IV: Content-Prompt Misalignment in Execution Step. Another challenge is that when indirect instructions are unrelated to the normal webpage content, ChatGPT could identify it and refuse to execute these instructions. We call this challenge “content-prompt misalignment”. As illustrated in Example II in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2.2 Threat Model ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), when ChatGPT is requested to access the target website where the indirect instructions diverge from the normal webpage content, it will first summarize the webpage content and read the indirect prompts. On recognizing the discrepancy between indirect prompts and normal webpage content, it perceives the instruction as unusual and refuses to execute it. This misalignment hinders the fulfillment of the Execution Step in WIPI.

Challenge V: Confirmation Request in Execution Step. Furthermore, we found that ChatGPT will request confirmation when receiving the instructions from the external target website. As demonstrated in Example III in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2.2 Threat Model ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), ChatGPT seeks further confirmation from the user before proceeding with the instruction, rather than executing it immediately. This illustrates that OpenAI has implemented specific safeguards to defend this vanilla WIPI attack, a strategy we refer to as “Confirmation Request”.

## 3 Methodology

Based on the above observations and challenges over the vanilla attack scheme, we propose a more advanced and stable WIPI attacking pipeline integrated with several explicitly designed strategies. As shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we design a universal template that guarantees the executability of the inserted prompts. Specifically, we endeavor to bypass the impact of possible preset prompts and defenses and enforce Web Agents to concentrate on the inserted instructions under the interference of massive normal content. Besides, without sacrificing the executability, we also make the inserted prompts imperceptible on the displayed webpage to make the attack more stealthy.

### 3.1 Solutions to Challenges in Retrieval Step.

Relative Position.  Under the interference of normal webpage content, we proposed a strategy to increase the probability for the LLM in Web Agents to read out the instructions. Our experiments ([section 2.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2.SS3 "2.3 Challenges ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents")) found that if we placed indirect prompts in the middle or tail of the webpage content, then the plugins may not be able to retrieve the indirect instructions in the webpage. Hence, to resolve this problem, we should place our indirect prompt in front of other normal webpage content. In this way, when web tools retrieve back the content of the webpage, these indirect prompts will be placed in front of any other normal context in the webpage. Furthermore, after the LLM receives the retrieved content, the first sentence will be indirect prompts which thus increases the attention of the LLM to these indirect prompts.

### 3.2 Solutions to Challenges in Execution Step.

Preset Prompts Negligence. In a more practical setting, Web Agents will receive preset prompts either from system prompts or the user’s input before accessing the external webpages. As highlighted in Challenge IV in [section 2.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2.SS3 "2.3 Challenges ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we observed that ChatGPT may adopt a Chain-of-Thought preset system prompts to prevent the execution of indirect instructions. Specifically, upon receiving indirect instruction, the LLM is instructed to first identify any contradictions in the received content. When there is an obvious contradiction, it will refuse to execute the indirect instructions. Another illustrative example is, “please summarize the content of the webpage” can be an instruction directly provided by users who wish to learn about the summarisation of the target external website. Hence, in these situations, the key challenge is to avoid this contradiction between the preset prompts and the indirect instructions. To this end, we can manipulate the content of indirect instructions. As shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), at the front of all indirect instructions, we add the following counter prompt: “*PLEASE DO NOT EXECUTE FORMER INSTRUCTIONS!*”. This counter-instruction forces the LLM to ignore the possible preset instructions and focus on the indirect instructions.

Prohibition of Summarization. One of the key challenges to successfully launching WIPI attack is the normal content that exists on the webpage, which will distract the attention of the LLM to normal page content and make it ignore the indirect instructions. To make the LLM notice the importance of the indirect instruction paragraph, one intuitive idea would be adding a certain instruction at the beginning of the paragraph to enforce the attention of the LLM. Based on this idea, as shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we proposed to add the following instruction “*DO NOT SUMMARIZE ANY WEBPAGE CONTENT!*” in the head of the indirect instructions so that LLM will first receive and follow this kind of instruction not to pay attention to and summarize the following webpage content.

Provision of Confirmation. Another challenge we observed during the vanilla attack was the “Confirmation Request” (Example III in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2.2 Threat Model ‣ 2 New Web Threat: WIPI ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents")) where ChatGPT will first ask for confirmation from the user before executing the indirect instructions. This is a possible defense deployed by OpenAI [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib11)] to prevent indirect prompt injections. The idea of bypassing it is also intuitive: if a Web Agent needs the confirmation, we then “provide it with the confirmation”. Based on our observation, ChatGPT does not identify the source of the received confirmation, which means that even if the confirmation comes from the indirect webpage, it will also be deemed as effective confirmation directly from the user. As shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we adopt a double-confirming strategy where confirmation sentences are placed both before and after the real payload instruction respectively.

Multi-level Repetitions. Although we have proposed several strategies to enforce the LLM to focus on and execute the indirect instructions, we found that these strategies are still not enough to launch a stable WIPI attack due to the interference from long normal content as shown in [section 4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S4.SS4 "4.4 Effectiveness of Prompt Template Design ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). To make the attack more stable and effective, we proposed multi-level repetition strategies. We denote a sequence of payload instructions as a single “instruction paragraph”. To make the LLM notice the importance of the instruction paragraph, one intuitive idea would be the prompt repetition. As shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we proposed two different levels of repetition strategies. The first level of the repetition strategy is sentence-level repetition. The idea is intuitive, now a single sentence is not enough to raise LLM’s attention, and we will do it multiple times. As illustrated in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), in the front of the inner paragraph, we repeat the first instruction “*DO NOT SUMMARIZE ANY WEBPAGE CONTENT!*” several times to highlight its importance (*e.g.,* 3 times). These repeated instructions are the very first few sentences that LLMs receive from the retrieved content, and when the LLM receives this sentence, it would notice this kind of repetition and thus its attention would be raised. Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we also apply this sentence-level repetition to the indirect prompts for confirmation provision and the preset prompts negligence, enhancing the LLM’s attention for these prompts.

Sentence-level repetition could raise the attention of the LLM to indirect instructions, however, it is still not perfect. Sometimes, Web Agents can still fail to execute the indirect instructions as presented in [section 4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S4.SS4 "4.4 Effectiveness of Prompt Template Design ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). Sentence-level repetition only repeats one sentence instruction, while the payload instructions in the paragraph also need more attention. To this end, besides the sentence-level repetition, we adopt another repetition strategy targeting over whole paragraph. As shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S0.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we repeat the whole indirect instruction (except prompts for preset prompts negligence) paragraph several times (*e.g.,* 3 times). This paragraph-level repetition will increase the occupation of whole indirect prompts but also highlight the importance of whole instruction content. Hence, the probability of LLMs executing indirect instructions will increase and the attack can be more stable.

### 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild.

Since WIPI involves publicly accessible web resources, we should hide the indirect prompts and make them imperceptible while being inspected by users. However, on the other hand, a good hiding strategy should not impact the executability, such that Web Agents can still read out and follow these indirect prompts. For common webpages, the displayed content is usually controlled by the deployment of a series of frontend codes, such as HTML [[50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib50)]. Hence, the source code and displayed content of the same webpage are at different two levels. Generally, users always get information at the second level from the displayed content, while for the common web extensional tools used in the Web Agents, information is retrieved at the first level from the source code. Considering the separate views, all we need is to make indirect prompts exist in the source code but hide from the displayed content, and it is easy to achieve this via some modifications of the source code. Specifically, our strategies for stealthiness are based on the following four attributes: Font Style: scale down the font size of those indirect prompts to an imperceptible level, *e.g.* 0.0001pt. Font Color: set the font color of indirect prompts to the same as the background color. For example, when we try to place an indirect prompt in a block with a white background, we can set the font color of the prompt to white. Font Opacity: set the font opacity of indirect prompts to 0. Layout Location: set the position of indirect prompts out of the screen. For instance, we can place it above and beyond the webpages.

Among all these four strategies, we choose font size as the main strategy for the main experiments and discuss the rest of the three strategies in [section 4.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S4.SS5 "4.5 Effectiveness under Stealthiness Strategies ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents").

## 4 Experiments

### 4.1 Experimental Settings

Target Web Agents. Our evaluation of the WIPI attack paradigm is conducted in a black-box setting, without any knowledge or modifications of system prompts and model parameters. We evaluated both commercial and open-sourced Web Agents. For the commercial Web Agents, we use two basic settings based on ChatGPT [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib7)]. The first is based on plugin-augmented GPT4, in which we evaluate 7 web plugins (including 6 free and 1 paid) after excluding those with functional flaws (e.g., cannot access or retrieve the normal content of the webpage). In the second configuration, we evaluate 8 well-known and functional sound Web GPTs—those with usage exceeding 900—based on three keywords (“Web”, “Search”, and “Browser”) searched within the GPTs store. For the open-sourced Web Agents, we tried almost all available Web Agents that claim to be able to carry out web search or navigation tasks. However, we found that they either cannot work normally or are just offline proofs-of-concept on local HTML datasets. Consequently, we build our own Web Agents via text-generation-webui [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib14)], a UI interface, and open-sourced model checkpoints from HuggingFace. Specifically, we implement a text-generation-webui extension for information retrieving from the Internet and equip the open-sourced LLM with it under the “chat-instruct” mode. For more specific investigations of open-sourced Web Agents, please refer to [appendix A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A1 "Appendix A Investigation on Open-sourced Web Agents ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents").

Payload Instruction. We set 10 payload instructions where 5 come from in Awesome-Chatgpt-Prompts dataset [[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib2)] (ACP), and the other 5 are constructed by ourselves. As shown in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), for the prompts from ACP, we choose the first 5 prompts after filtering out those requiring additional tools (e.g., other plugins or auxiliary tools). For the prompts constructed by ourselves, we craft 5 special prompts that are normal from the users’ perspective but malicious and dangerous when executed by external objects. By default, we directly input the URL of the target external webpages. Additionally, we also conduct experiments when integrating with preset instructions from the user’s input prefix such as “*please summarize the content of the webpage: {URL}*” where *URL* is an external webpage link. We consider 4 different preset instructions in our ablation study, and details can be found in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A3.T14 "Table 14 ‣ Appendix C Detailed Results for the 𝐴⁢𝑆⁢𝑅_{𝑝⁢𝑎⁢𝑔⁢𝑒} of attacking plugin-augmented GPT4 ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents") in [appendix A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A1 "Appendix A Investigation on Open-sourced Web Agents ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents").

Prompt Carrier. For the indirect prompt carriers, we choose 4 different types of real-world webpages: 1) *page1* for News (New York Times [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib10)]), 2) *page2* for Forum (Reddit [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib13)]), 3) *page3* for Personal Blog (Connelly [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib12)]), and 4) *page4* for Search Engine (Google Search [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib5)]). We first clone 4 vanilla webpages from the original websites and then inject different prompts into the vanilla webpages to construct malicious webpages.

Evaluation Metric. To obtain fair experiment results, for each prompt, we tested 5 times and recorded the number of successful attacks and failed attacks. One attack is successful if Web Agents execute the payload instruction. We use the following metric, Top-1 ASR, denoted as the average attack success rate in 5 times experiments. Furthermore, we denote plugin-wise, prompt-wise, and page-wise ASR respectively as $ASR_{plugin}$, $ASR_{prompt}$, and $ASR_{page}$.

### 4.2 Main Results

Results for Web Plugins. As depicted in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), our WIPI attack obtains great performance, with 93.86% average total ASR. To begin with, upon comparing our results to various web plugins, it becomes evident that the ASR for most web plugins exceeds 90%, proving the exceptional attack performance of our methodology. Specifically, when using different indirect payload prompts, such as *prompt2*, *prompt9*, and *prompt10*, we consistently achieve a perfect 100% ASR across all web plugins. Moreover, except *prompt7*, on the other 9 different prompts we obtain an impressive ASR of over 93% when tested on various web pages. Among all the 10 different prompts, *prompt7* has a relatively lower overall ASR compared with the other 9 payload prompts. However, the ASR can exceed 60%, which still provides a relatively high probability for the ChatGPT to redirect to the target webpage. This indicates that although OpenAI may have implemented certain defenses to prevent indirect web redirects, they are not strong enough and could be bypassed via our methodology. For 4 different webpages, the results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack methods. On each page, our method can achieve a stable attack with an average ASR over 92%. These results showcase the universal effectiveness of our method over diverse web plugins, prompts, and webpages.

Results for Web GPTs. The attack performance for 8 Web GPTs is shown in Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents")^(††\dagger†)^(††\dagger†)$\dagger$Due to the page limitation, we put detailed results in Table [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A4.T15 "Table 15 ‣ Appendix D Detailed Payload Instructions ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents") in appendix [appendix D](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A4 "Appendix D Detailed Payload Instructions ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). The overall ASR for all Web GPTs is 90.94%. Among all 8 Web GPTs, Aaron Browser [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib1)] is the weakest Web GPT where the ASR on it is the highest, up to 96.5%. Although KeyMate AI GPT [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib9)] shows tiny robustness towards the attack, the ASR is still a relatively high number, 81.5%. Furthermore, for all of the 10 prompts, the ASR of *prompt2*, 4, 8, and 10 are all above 97.5%, a number near 100%. Prompt7 shows similar attack performance as shown in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents") where the ASR is 78.75%, the second lowest among all 10 prompts. Regarding $ASR_{page}$, Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents") illustrates that the attack performance remains consistently stable across all four different webpages for most Web GPT models. This result provides solid evidence supporting the stability of our attack methodology on Web GPTs under different webpages.

Results for Open-Sourced Web Agents. To obtain more comprehensive results, we also conduct experiments over open-sourced Web Agents. Specifically, we evaluate WIPI on Web Agents driven by three different LLMs: NeuralMarcoro14-7B[[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib18)], Mixtral-8x7B[[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib31)], and Tulu-2-DPO-70B[[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib29)]. As shown in Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), WIPI can successfully attack all these 3 different LLM backbones with an overall 100% ASR. This indicates the effectiveness of WIPI.

### 4.3 Robustness on Preset Prompts.

We also evaluate the robustness of WIPI under the interference of preset prompts. Under a black-box setting, we are unable to modify the system prompts. Thus, we instead consider a more practical setting where the user can add prefix instructions related to the webpage in front of the target URL like “*please summarize the content of the webpage: {URL}*”, our attack still obtains a relatively high ASR. As presented in Table [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T6 "Table 6 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we apply 4 different most common user prefix instructions for web-related tasks to evaluate the robustness of our proposed attack pipeline. We evaluate our attack under the mentioned 4 prefix instructions via the most popular web plugin, Web Pilot [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib17)]. As shown in Table [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T7 "Table 7 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), although the ASR drops slightly (4% on average) compared to the main setting where we directly input the URL without any additional content, the overall ASR achieves a minimal 92.5% under all these 4 different prefix instructions. We also switch the web plugins and fix the prefix instruction as “please summarize the content of the following website” to evaluate the attack performance. The results are depicted in Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). The average drop in ASR for 4 different Web plugins is around 9%, which is a tiny number and the overall ASR still keeps a high number even with 4 different web plugins. These two groups of experiments prove the robustness of our attack methodology across diverse preset prompts and web tools, and that it can effectively ignore the user’s input and execute the payload instruction which echoes the “Preset Prompt Negligence” design in [section 3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 Solutions to Challenges in Execution Step. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents").

### 4.4 Effectiveness of Prompt Template Design

Vanilla Setting. To comprehensively study the effectiveness of the designed prompt template, at first, we directly inject the payload instructions into webpages without any auxiliary prompts. The results are depicted in Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). When directly injecting payload instructions into the webpage, the overall ASR is only 35.5%, 61.5% less than our main methodology where our explicitly designed template is applied. This result reflects the effectiveness of our methodology. Furthermore, we found that among 10 different prompts, *prompt5* to *prompt10* have more significant ASR drops, up to 80% on average. This result indicates that the last 5 instructions are more challenging compared with the first 5 prompts and our template can effectively improve the probability of executing more challenging instructions.

Prohibition of Summarization. One of the key designs of our template is the prompt of Prohibition of Summarization which can effectively force Web Agents to pay more attention to the payload instructions instead of the other normal webpage content. To evaluate the effectiveness of this design, we delete all auxiliary prompts and test the attack performance over Web Pilot. The results are shown in Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), when deleting related prompts, the ASR drops quickly. The overall ASR is only 31% which is 66% less than the main methodology result. This result proves the effectiveness of the Prohibition of Summarization. Furthermore, we can also find that the ASR is even 4.5% lower than the ASR of the vanilla method. This proves that when lacking Prohibition of Summarization, the remaining part in the template cannot improve the attack performance and it could decrease the performance. We guess that the remaining content of the template can increase the contradiction between the normal content which can then be detected by the ChatGPT, thereby being refused to execute.

Repetition Strategies. One key design of our template is the two repetition strategies. Hence, there is a need to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies.

Sentence-level Repetition Ablation. For the sentence-level repetition strategy, we modify the template by deleting all sentence-level repetition prompts and reattack the Web Pilot without prefix instructions. The result is illustrated in Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). The overall ASR is 79%, 18% lower than the main methodology, which proves the effectiveness of the sentence-level repetition strategy.

Paragraph-level Repetition Ablation. The other repetition strategy is paragraph repetition. To verify the effectiveness of this type of repetition, we delete all paragraph-level repetition prompts in the template and reconduct the attack experiment over Web Pilot. The attack performance is shown in Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). The overall ASR is 81.5%, 15.5% lower than the main methodology, and the most important improvement is the $ASR_{prompt}$ of prompt7, which increases by 65%. This result proves the effectiveness of this paragraph-level repetition strategy.

Both Repetition Strategy Ablation. When we delete both of these repetition strategies, the result is shown in Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). The performance is 75.5%, lower than both the without sentence-level repetition setting and the without paragraph-level setting. This shows that both of the repetition strategies contribute to the final effectiveness of the template.

Comfirmation Privision. Finally, one of the most important designs in the template lies in the confirmation provision. To investigate the effectiveness of this strategy, we delete all prompts related to this strategy and reconduct the attack over Web Pilot. The result is shown in Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), the overall ASR is 67% which is 30% lower than the main methodology. When without such a strategy, the attack performance drops quickly. This showcases the effectiveness of the confirmation provision. Furthermore, this also proves that providing the confirmation in the external content can successfully mislead ChatGPT to treat this confirmation as the confirmation directly from the users which reveals one key vulnerability of ChatGPT: the mechanism for identifying the source of the information (*e.g.,* confirmation) is too weak to be robust.

### 4.5 Effectiveness under Stealthiness Strategies

To achieve the stealthiness of WIPI, we proposed 4 different hiding strategies. And we conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our attack after applying these stealthiness strategies. Specifically, we only switch the stealthiness strategies and keep the remaining parts in the main methodology the same. For the font size, we have introduced the attack performance in the former sections where we set the size as 0.000001px. For the color of the font, we set it as the same as the background color. We also set the opacity of the indirect prompts to 0 to make them invisible to human eyes. Additionally, for the location of the indirect prompts, we set it in the above the main page by setting the position parameter “top=-1000000000px”. The attack performance under these 4 different strategies is shown in Table [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T10 "Table 10 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), and all these strategies can successfully achieve high ASR. Furthermore, for most prompts, these strategies can achieve almost 100% ASR. These results demonstrate that the stealthiness strategies will not degrade the executability of indirect prompts.

### 4.6 Case Study of Potential Security Threats

Our comprehensive experiments with perfect attack results prove the feasibility of the WIPI pipeline. To further reveal the potential security impact of WIPI, we conduct the following case studies. Specifically, we choose 3 different types of malicious prompts (*prompt7*, *prompt8*, and *prompt9*) aimed at different security threats.

First, as shown in Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), when we instruct web-plugin-based GPT4 to visit *page1*, the *prompt7* embedded in the webpage successfully makes ChatGPT call the web plugin (Web Pilot [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib17)]) to redirect to the target webpage (CSRanking [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib3)]) and display the content of target webpage. Once the target webpage is maliciously designed, this kind of web redirect will introduce carefully designed content such as deceptive information, the user will be deceived and cause property losses.

Second, as shown in Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), when we request Web Pilot GPT to visit *page1* with *prompt8* embedded, the indirect instructions successfully make Web Pilot GPT prompt a deceptive phishing link, “Here”. Once the users trust Web Pilot GPT and click this phishing link, they will expose themselves to a range of risks, including identity theft, financial fraud, malware infections, and compromised privacy.

Third, as shown in Figure [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), when we request the web-plugin-based GPT4 to visit *page1* with *prompt9* embedded where we replace the image link with the image with a hacker image, the indirect instructions successfully make web-plugin-based GPT4 render and display “Hacker” image.

These cases demonstrate the potential of WIPI to cause practical security threats.

### 4.7 Stealthiness under Web Safeguards

To verify and investigate if traditional web safeguards could detect this new threat WIPI, we utilize 2 popular webpage URL scanners and detectors, VirusTotal [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib15)] and IPQS [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib8)]. These tools employ a combination of signature-based, heuristic-based, and machine-learning-based detection techniques.

Detection Metric. In VirusTotal, when we scan a URL, it provides us with detection results aggregated from 91 different security vendors. For each unique prompt and webpage combination, we record the results from these 91 vendors. For the IPQS malicious URL scanner, it will only return one result to show if the given webpage is malicious.

Overall Results. The results via VirusTotal are shown in Table [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T11 "Table 11 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). The detection results show that for *page1*, *page3*, and *page4*, all the security vendors deem them as clear and secure. Meanwhile, we found that the vanilla *page2* without any indirect prompts is categorized as a phishing” webpage by only one of the 91 vendors. We think this is because the content of *page2* is copied from the original webpage (Reddit), leading this vendor to believe the content does not align with the given URL, thereby marking it as suspicious. As a result, after indirect prompts are injected into *page2*, the detection results remain consistent. Across all 10 prompts, only one security vendor (the same vendor mentioned above) identifies the webpages as suspicious, while the remaining vendors still consider the webpage as clear and secure. The result via IPQS malicious URL scanner is shown in Table [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S3.T12 "Table 12 ‣ 3.3 Steathiness in the Wild. ‣ 3 Methodology ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), and IPQS cannot detect WIPI and recognizes all the webpages with different prompts secure. These results prove that WIPI obtains great stealthiness and currently cannot be detected by common security scanners and detectors.

Among those injected prompts, *prompt7* requests the Web Agents to visit another webpage. This is a new type of web redirect, we can call it language-based indirect web redirect. Although different from traditional web redirects driven by executable code, it can cause severe security issues when it directly makes Web Agents redirect to the malicious websites that are controlled by the attacker. However, our experiment results show that both of these two web scanners failed to identify such language-based indirect web redirect which calls for our urgent attention.

Figure 8: The anonymous webpage we constructed, injected with *prompt1*. It just looks like a normal personal blog, displaying nothing suspicious.

![Refer to caption](img/8258c435f206dd17f35f0cc6ea876ca7.png)

Figure 9: When we request ChatGPT to search the keywords in the webpage shown in Figure [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 4.7 Stealthiness under Web Safeguards ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), the indirect prompt is successfully injected and executed.

### 4.8 Exploration on Search-based WIPI

For the experiments we introduce above, we consider a basic scenario where a user wants to know the content of a given specific URL. In this section, we briefly discuss another practical scenario where the target URL is not given and the user wants to search for information via some keywords. In this scenario, the Web Agents will first utilize web tools to retrieve some specific webpages related to the keywords provided by the user, and then generate the response based on the retrieved content. To investigate if WIPI can also be effective in this keyword search task, we construct an example website and conduct a case study.

As shown in Figure [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S4.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 4.7 Stealthiness under Web Safeguards ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), we craft and release an anonymous webpage with the specific keyword “WIPI4396” and then embed *prompt1* into this webpage. After that, we leverage Web Pilot to request ChatGPT to search the keywords by providing the prompt “*seach “WIPI4396” for me*”, the result is shown in Figure [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#S4.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ 4.7 Stealthiness under Web Safeguards ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"). The indirect prompt is successfully executed and the ChatGPT replies with the indirect instruction to act as a Linux terminal. This case reveals that search-based WIPI is possible and can also inject and make Web Agents execute external instructions.

## 5 Related Works

Web Agents. Large language models (LLMs) have kept surging in the community of artificial intelligence in recent years. Benefiting from the massive text data on the Internet and more advanced computational devices, LLMs [[49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib49), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib7), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib53), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib52), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib19)] are constructed with up to hundreds of billions of parameters and getting much stronger performance on various tasks and moving the community a remarkable step towards artificial general intelligence. Based on their superior capability of language understanding and reasoning, many LLM-driven Web Agents have been proposed to help people search and organize web resources. Some of them [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib16), [61](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib61), [65](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib65)] create simulated web environments and train the agents to carry on tasks like answering given questions based on information from related webpages or finding and purchasing specific products online. Usually, they take text-formatted content as input. A special case is WebGUM[[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib25)] which takes both webpage screenshots and HTML as input and generates web navigation actions like typing or clicking. Besides, some LLM-driven Agents[[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib59), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib22), [66](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib66), [58](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib58)], although not specifically designed for web tasks, also obtain the capability of retrieving external resources and can be used as Web Agents.

Prompt Injection. Prompt injection [[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib37), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib46), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib39), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib47), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib45), [54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib54), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib48), [63](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib63), [62](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib62), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib27), [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib38)] craft prompts in the user’s input messages to trick the LLM into ignoring its predefined rules or system prompts and following the user’s instructions. Some prompt injections, which are called *jailbreak attacks* [[57](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib57), [64](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib64), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib51), [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib23)], aim to elect harmful contents, *e.g.* misleading information and unethical opinions. On the other hand, Greshake et. al. [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#bib.bib27)] introduce the concept of indirect prompt injection, which is not located inside the user’s input, and provide an analysis of various scenarios where LLM applications are under the threat of indirect prompt injection. In this case, an attacker does not have to be the direct user, while able to control the LLM’s behaviors via tampering with its retrieval database or accessible online resources. However, existing studies overlook the attack for a more practical LLM-driven system. Their focus remains confined to individual LLMs, neglecting consideration of the whole system. In this paper, we focus on the indirect prompt injection from web pages in a totally practical setting, which is an increasingly critical threat, as more and more users are relying on LLM applications for web browsing and searching.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce a novel web threat termed WIPI, which differs from traditional web threats that rely on executable code, as WIPI operates purely through natural language. In contrast to former works that target only the LLMs within Web Agents, WIPI aims at the entire Web Agent system. Built on an initial analysis of a basic attack over ChatGPT, we observed several critical challenges. In response, we develop a universal prompt template designed to facilitate the execution of payload instructions. Meanwhile, to enhance the stealthiness of the attack, we implement four techniques that focus on font style and layout location of the indirect instructions. Our comprehensive experiments, incorporating 7 ChatGPT web plugins, 8 Web GPTs, and 3 open-source Web Agents, demonstrate that even under black-box conditions, our method consistently achieves an average attack success rate of over 90%. We reveal the vulnerabilities of current Web Agents and provide insights for more secure LLM system design in the future.

## Appendix A Investigation on Open-sourced Web Agents

We undertake a thorough investigation into the capability of retrieving our deployed webpages of the open-sourced Web Agents. The findings, presented in Table [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A1.T13 "Table 13 ‣ Appendix A Investigation on Open-sourced Web Agents ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents"), reveal that across 8 different open-sourced Web Agents, none successfully retrieved the content of our deployed webpages. These results motivate us to develop our own open-sourced Web Agents.

Table 13: Investigating the functionality of retrieving external webpages of the current Web Agents.

Figure 10: When Tulu-2-DPO-70B accesses *page1* via the web tool, malicious indirect prompts successfully instruct it to generate misleading information.

## Appendix B Case study for Open-Sourced Web Agent

Figure [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16965v1#A1.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ Appendix A Investigation on Open-sourced Web Agents ‣ WIPI: A New Web Threat for LLM-Driven Web Agents") shows an example of the open-sourced Web Agent attacked by WIPI. Even with a strong prefix that requires it not to follow any instructions from the website, it still generates misleading information, indicating that open-sourced models seem more vulnerable than commercial models like ChatGPT.
