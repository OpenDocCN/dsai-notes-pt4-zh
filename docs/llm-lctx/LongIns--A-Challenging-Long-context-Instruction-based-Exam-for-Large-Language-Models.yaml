- en: 'The long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a hot
    topic in recent years. To evaluate LLMs’ performance in different scenarios, various
    assessment benchmarks have emerged. However, as most of these benchmarks focus
    on identifying key information to answer questions, which mainly requires the
    retrieval ability of LLMs, these benchmarks can partially represent the reasoning
    performance of LLMs from large amounts of information. Meanwhile, although LLMs
    often claim to have context windows of 32k, 128k, 200k, or even longer, these
    benchmarks fail to reveal the actual supported length of these LLMs. To address
    these issues, we propose the LongIns benchmark dataset, a challenging long-context
    instruction-based exam for LLMs, which is built based on the existing instruction
    datasets. Specifically, in our LongIns, we introduce three evaluation settings:
    Global Instruction & Single Task (GIST), Local Instruction & Single Task (LIST),
    and Local Instruction & Multiple Tasks (LIMT). Based on LongIns, we perform comprehensive
    evaluations on existing LLMs and have the following important findings: (1). The
    top-performing GPT-4 with 128k context length performs poorly on the evaluation
    context window of 16k in our LongIns. (2). For the multi-hop reasoning ability
    of many existing LLMs, significant efforts are still needed under short context
