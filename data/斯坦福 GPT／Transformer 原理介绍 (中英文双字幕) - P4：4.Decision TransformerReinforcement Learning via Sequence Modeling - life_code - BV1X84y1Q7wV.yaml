    we even care about this problem。So we have seen in the last。Three or four years，

- en: So with all of these advances， it seems like we are getting closer to having
    a unified model for decision making for artificial intelligence。But artificial
    intelligence is much more about not just having perception。but also using the
    perception knowledge to make decisions。And this is what this talk is going to
    be about。But before I go into actually thinking about how we will use these models

  zh: 随着这些进展，似乎我们越来越接近于为人工智能建立一个统一的决策模型。但人工智能不仅仅涉及感知，还涉及如何利用感知知识做出决策。这就是本次演讲的主题。但在我深入探讨如何使用这些模型进行决策之前。
- en: here is a motivation for why I think it is important to ask this question。So
    unlike models for RL。when we look at transformers for perception modalities like
    I showed in the previous slide。we find that these models are very scalable and
    have very stable training dynamics so you can keep as long as you have enough
    computation and you have more and more data that can be sourced。you can train
    bigger and bigger models and you'll see very smooth reductions in the loss。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这里是我认为询问这个问题重要性的动机。因此，与强化学习模型不同，当我们查看变换器在感知模式上的表现时，就像我在前一张幻灯片中展示的那样，我们发现这些模型非常可扩展，并且具有非常稳定的训练动态。因此，只要你有足够的计算能力和越来越多的可获取数据，你就可以训练越来越大的模型，并且可以看到损失平滑下降。
- en: And the overall training dynamics are very stable， and this makes it very easy
    for practitioners and researchers to build these models and learn richer and richer
    distributions。So like I said， all of these advances have so far occurred in perception
    what we've been interested in this talk is to think about how we can go from perception。
  id: totrans-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 整体训练动态非常稳定，这使得从业者和研究人员构建这些模型并学习更丰富的分布变得非常简单。因此，正如我所说，这些进展迄今为止主要发生在感知方面，而我们在本次演讲中关注的是如何从感知转向。
- en: looking at images， looking at text and all these kinds of sensory signals to
    then going into the field of actually taking actions and making our agents do
    interesting things in the world。😊，啊。And here throughout the talk， we should be
    thinking about why this perspective is going to enable us to do scalable learning。

  zh: 我们需要观察图像、文本和各种感官信号，然后进入实际采取行动的领域，让我们的智能体在世界中做出有趣的事情。😊，啊。在整个演讲中，我们应该考虑为什么这种视角能够让我们实现可扩展学习。
- en: like I showed on the previous slide， as well as brings stability into the whole
    procedure。😊。So sequential decision making is a very broad area and what I'm specifically
    going to be focusing on today is the one route to sequential decision making that's
    reinforcement learning。

  zh: 就像我在前一张幻灯片上展示的那样，也为整个过程带来了稳定性。😊。因此，顺序决策是一个非常广泛的领域，我今天要特别关注的是通往顺序决策的一个路径，即强化学习。
- en: So just as a brief background， what is reinforcement learning。so we are given
    an agent who' is in a current state and the agent is going to interact with the
    environment by taking actions。And by taking these actions， the environment is
    going to return to it a reward。For how good that action was as well as next state
    into which the agent will transition and this whole feedback loop will continue。
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以简单介绍一下，什么是强化学习。我们给定一个处于当前状态的代理，该代理将通过采取行动与环境进行互动。通过采取这些行动，环境将给它返回一个奖励，以评估该行动的好坏，以及代理将转移到的下一个状态，这整个反馈循环将继续进行。
- en: 啊。The goal here for an intelligent agent is to then using trial and error。so
    try out different actions， see what rewards will lead to learn a policy which
    maps your states to actions such that the policy maximizes the agent's cumulative
    rewards over time horizon。
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 啊。这里智能代理的目标是通过试错来实现。所以尝试不同的动作，看看什么奖励能够引导，学习一种将状态映射到动作的策略，以便最大化代理在时间跨度内的累积奖励。
- en: So you take a sequence of actions and then based on the reward you accumulate
    for that sequence of actions。will' judge how good your policy is。This talk is
    also going to be specifically focused on a form of reinforcement learning that
    goes by the name of offline reinforcement learning。
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以你进行一系列动作，然后根据你为这一系列动作积累的奖励来判断你的策略有多好。这次讲座还将特别关注一种名为离线强化学习的强化学习形式。
- en: So the idea here is that what changes from the previous picture where I was
    talking about online learning。online reinforcement learning is that here now instead
    of doing actively interacting with the environment。you have a collection of log
    data of interactions so think about some robot that's going out in the fields
    and it collects a bunch of sensory data and you have all logged it and using that
    log data you now want to train another agent。it could be another robot to then
    learn something interesting about that environment just by looking at the log
    data。
  id: totrans-13

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以这里的想法是，和我之前谈论在线学习的图像相比，在线强化学习的变化在于，现在不再是主动与环境互动，而是拥有一组交互的日志数据。想象一下某个机器人在田野中收集了一堆传感器数据，并且你已经记录了所有这些数据，利用这些日志数据，你现在想训练另一个代理，也许是另一个机器人，仅仅通过查看日志数据来学习关于该环境的有趣信息。
- en: G so theres no trial and error component。Which is currently one of the extensions
    of this framework。which would be very exciting， so I'll talk about this towards
    the end of the talk why it's exciting to think about how we can extend this framework
    to include an exploration component and have trial and error。

  zh: G，因此没有试错成分。这目前是该框架的一个扩展，将会非常激动人心，所以我将在讲座结束时谈谈为什么思考如何扩展这个框架以包括探索成分并进行试错是令人兴奋的。
- en: Okay， so not to go more concretely into what the motivating challenge of the
    stock was now that they have introduced ArL。so let's look at some statistics。So
    large language models。I have billions of parameters and they have today they have
    roughly about 100 layers in Transformer。they are very stable to train using supervised
    learning， style losses。
  id: totrans-15

  zh: 好的，不再具体讨论股票的激励挑战，既然他们已经引入了ArL。那么我们来看看一些统计数据。大型语言模型拥有数十亿的参数，今天它们大约有100层的Transformer。它们在使用监督学习和风格损失时非常稳定。
- en: which are the building blocks of autoregressive generation， for instance。or
    for mass language modeling as in B。And this is like a field that's growing every
    day and there's a course on it at Stanford that we're all taking just because
    it has had such a monumental impact on AI。

  zh: 这些是自回归生成的构建块，例如，或者用于大规模语言建模的B模型。这是一个每天都在增长的领域，斯坦福大学有一门课程，我们都在参加，因为它对人工智能产生了巨大的影响。
- en: 嗯。RL policies， on the other hand， and I'm talking about deep RL。the maximum
    they would extend to is maybe millions of parameters at 20 layers。嗯。And what's
    really unnerving is that they're very unstable to train so the current algorithms
    for reinforcement learning they build on mostly dynamic programming which involves
    solving an inter loop optimization problem that's very unstable and it's very
    common to see practitioners in RL looking at reward reward code that look like
    this so what I really want you to see here is the variance in the returns that
    we tend to get in RL it's really huge even after doing multiple rounds of experimentation
    and that's often that is really at the code got to done with the fact that。
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 嗯。另一方面，强化学习策略，尤其是深度强化学习，其最大参数量大概在2000万个参数和20层之间。嗯。更让人不安的是，它们的训练非常不稳定，因此目前的强化学习算法主要基于动态编程，涉及解决一个非常不稳定的内循环优化问题。在强化学习中，实践者经常看到这样的奖励代码，所以我希望你能看到在RL中我们得到的回报的方差非常大，即使在进行多轮实验后，这往往与代码本身的复杂性有关。
- en: Our algorithms learning checks need better improvements so that the performance
    can be stably achieved by Asians。In complex environments。So what this work is
    hoping to do is it's meant to introduce transformers。And I'll first show in one
    slide what exactly that model looks like and we're going to go into deeper details

  zh: 谢谢，我好奇的是，为什么强化学习（RL）通常参数量比其他方法少几个数量级？
- en: That's a great question， so typically when you think about reinforcement learning
    algorithms。😊。In deep art in particular， so the most common algorithms， for example。have
    different networks playing different roles in the task so you'll have a network
    for instance。playing the role of an actor so trying to figure out a policy and
    then therell a different network that's playing the role of a critic。

  zh: 这是个好问题，通常当你考虑强化学习算法时。😊。特别是在深度学习中，最常见的算法例如，有不同的网络在任务中扮演不同的角色，你会有一个网络扮演演员的角色，试图找出策略，还有一个不同的网络扮演评论者的角色。
- en: And these networks are trained on data that's adaptively gathered so unlike
    perception where you will have a huge data set of interactions on which you can
    train your models in this case the architectures and even the environments to
    some extent。are very simplistic because of the fact that we are trying to train
    very small components the functions that we're training and then bringing them
    all together and these functions are often trained in not super complex environments。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这些网络在自适应收集的数据上进行训练，因此与感知任务不同，在感知中你会有一个巨大的交互数据集来训练模型，而在这种情况下，架构甚至在某种程度上环境都非常简单，因为我们试图训练非常小的组件，我们训练的函数，然后将它们结合在一起，这些函数通常是在不太复杂的环境中训练的。
- en: so it's a mix of different issues I wouldn't say it's purely just got to with
    the fact that the learning objectives are fault。but it's a combination of the
    environments we use the combination of the targets that each of the neural networks
    are predicting which leads to networks which are much bigger than。

  zh: 这涉及到不同的问题，我不会说这纯粹与学习目标有关，而是与我们使用的环境、每个神经网络预测的目标的组合有关，这导致网络的规模比预期要大得多。
- en: What we currently see tending to or， and that's why it's very common to see
    neural networks with much fewer layers being used in RL as opposed to perception。Thank
    you。You want to ask a questionep yeah， I was going to is there a reason why you
    chose offline RL versus online RL？
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我们目前看到的倾向，正因为如此，强化学习中使用的神经网络通常层数要比感知任务少很多。谢谢。你想问个问题吗？是的，我想知道为什么你选择离线强化学习而不是在线强化学习？
- en: That's another great question so the question is why offline R is opposed to
    online RL and the plain reason is because all this is a first work trying to look
    at reinforcement learning so offline RL avoids this problem of exploration。You
    are given a log data set of interactions you're not allowed to further interact
    with the environment so just from this data set you're trying to unearth a policy
    of what the optimal agent would look like so it would right like if you do online
    RL wouldn't that like just give you this opportunity of exploration basically
    it would it would what would also do which is a technically challenging here is
    that the exploration would be harder to encode so offline R is the first step
    there is no reason why we should not study why online RL cannot be done it's just
    that it provides a more contained setup where ideas from transformers will directly
    extend。
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这是另一个很好的问题，问题是为什么离线强化学习（R）与在线强化学习（RL）对立，简单的原因是，因为这是第一次尝试研究强化学习，所以离线RL避免了探索的问题。你得到了一个交互的日志数据集，不能进一步与环境交互，因此仅从这个数据集中，你试图挖掘出最优代理的策略。如果你进行在线RL，难道不会给你这个探索的机会吗？基本上会，但技术上更具挑战的是，探索会更难编码。因此，离线R是第一步，没有理由不研究为什么在线RL不能做到，只是它提供了一个更封闭的设置，其中来自变换器的想法将直接扩展。
- en: Okay， sounds good， so let's look at the model and it's really simple on purpose。So
    what we're going to do is we're going to look at our offline data。which is essentially
    in the form of tra trees， so offline data would look like a sequence of states。actions，
    returns over multiple time steps。It's a sequence that's natural to think of us
    as directly feeding as input to a transformer in this case we use a causal transformer
    as it's common in GPT。
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 好的，听起来不错，那么我们来看看模型，它故意做得非常简单。我们要做的是查看我们的离线数据，基本上是以树形结构的形式呈现的，离线数据看起来像是多个时间步中的状态序列、行动、回报。这是一个自然的序列，可以直接作为输入提供给变换器，在这种情况下，我们使用的是因果变换器，这在GPT中很常见。
- en: So we go from left to right and because the data set comes with the notion of
    time step causality here is much more well intended than the general meaning that's
    used for perception this is really causality how it should be in perspective of
    time。What we predict out of this transformer are the actions conditioned on everything
    that comes before that token in the sequence。
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以我们从左到右，因为数据集带有时间步因果性的概念，这里比用于感知的一般意义更具意图。这实际上是如何从时间的角度看待因果关系。我们从这个变换器预测的，是基于序列中该令牌之前所有内容的条件下的行动。
- en: So if you want to predict the action at this t minus one step， we'll use everything
    that came。At time step D minus two， as well as the returns and states at time
    step D minus one。Okay。So we will go into the details of how exactly each of these
    are encoded。but essentially this is in a one liner， it's taking the tragic pre
    datata from the offline data。
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以如果你想预测在这个t减一的步骤中的行动，我们将利用之前所有的信息。在D减二的时间步，以及在D减一的时间步中的回报和状态。好的。所以我们将深入了解这些是如何被编码的。但从本质上讲，这就是一条线，它从离线数据中提取悲惨的预数据。
- en: treating it as a sequence of tokens， passing it through a causal transformer
    and getting a sequence of actions as the output。Okay， so how exactly do we do
    the forward path through the network？
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 将其视为一个令牌序列，经过因果变换器处理，得到一系列行动作为输出。那么，我们到底如何在网络中进行前向传播呢？
- en: So one important aspect of this work， which is the U states' actions and this
    quantity called returns to room。So these are not direct rewards。These are returns
    to go and let's see what they really mean。So this is a trajectory that goes as
    input。and the returns to go are the sum of rewards starting from the current time
    step into until the end of the episode。So really what we want the transformer
    is to get better at using a target return。
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因此，这项工作的一个重要方面是U状态的行动和这个称为“返回”的量。因此这些不是直接的奖励。这些是未来回报，让我们看看它们的真正含义。这是一条作为输入的轨迹，未来回报是从当前时间步到该剧集结束的奖励总和。因此，我们希望变换器能够更好地使用目标返回。
- en: this is how you should think of returns to go。As the input in deciding what
    action to take。This perspective is going to have multiple advantages if it willll
    allow us to actually do much more than offline RL and generalizing to different
    tasks by just changing the returns to go。
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这就是你应该如何看待未来回报作为决定采取什么行动的输入。这种视角将有多个优势，它将使我们能够做更多的事情，超越离线RL，并通过仅改变未来回报来泛化到不同的任务。
- en: And here it's very important， so at time step one we will just have the overall
    sum of rewards for the entire tragic dream at time step two we subtract the reward
    we get by taking the first action and then have the sum of rewards for the remainder
    of the tragic dream。

  zh: 在这一点上非常重要，因此在时间步长一，我们将仅拥有整个悲惨梦境的总体奖励之和；在时间步长二，我们减去采取第一行动所获得的奖励，然后获得悲惨梦境其余部分的奖励之和。
- en: Okay， so that's how we quality turns to go like how many more rewards in accumulation
    you need to acquire to fulfill your。Re your return goal that is set the beginning。What
    is the output。the output is the sequence of predicted actions， so as I showed
    in the previous slide。we use a causal transformer so we predict in sequence the
    desired actions。The attention， which is。

  zh: 好的，这就是我们如何质量转向的方式，像是你需要积累多少更多的奖励来实现你在开始时设定的返回目标。输出是什么？输出是预测行动的序列，正如我在上一张幻灯片中展示的。我们使用因果变换器，因此我们按顺序预测所需的行动。注意力。
- en: Going to be computed inside the transformer with taking an important hyperparameter
    key。which is the context length。We see that in perception as well here， and for
    the rest of the talk。I'm going to use the notation K to denote how many tokens
    in the past would we be attending over to predict the action and the current time
    step。Okay， so again， digging a little bit deeper into code。

- en: There are some subtle differences with how a decision transformer operates as
    opposed to a normal transformer。the first is that here the time step notion is
    going to be。哦。Have a much bigger semantics that extends across three tokens。So

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 决策变换器与普通变换器的操作有一些微妙的差异。首先，这里的时间步长概念将具有更大的语义，扩展到三个标记。因此在感知中，你只需考虑每个单词的时间步长，例如在
    NLP 中，或每个补丁在视觉中。
- en: and in this case we will have a time step encapsulating three tokens， one for
    the states。one for the actions and one for the rewards。And then we embed each
    of these tokens and then add the pollution embedding as it common in the transformer
    and we feed those inputs to the transformer at the output we only care about one
    of these fee tokens in those default side I will say experiments where even the
    other tokens might be of interest as target predictions but for now let's keep
    it simple。

- en: we want to learn a policy a policy which is trying to predict actions。So when

- en: it leads to different functions being encoded in our case it was editioned。O。Why
    did you try the other one and it just didn't work or why is that because I think
    intuitively concatenating would like make more sense。So I think both of them have
    different use cases for the functional of encoding like one is really mixing in
    the embeddings for the state and basically shifting it so and you add something
    if you think of the embedding of the states as a vector and you add something
    you are actually shifting it。

  zh: 这导致了不同功能的编码，在我们的案例中是版本化的O。你为什么尝试另一个，而它不起作用？或者说，为什么这样？因为我觉得直观上串联似乎更有意义。因此，我认为它们在编码功能上有不同的用例，一个是真正混合状态的嵌入并基本上进行位移，如果你把状态的嵌入视为一个向量，添加某些东西实际上是在位移。
- en: Whereas in the concatetnation case， you are actually increasing the dimensionality
    of this space。😊。Yeah呀。So those are different choices which are doing very different

    you're shifting it right like if you have an em bedding for a state and let's
    say like you perform certain actions and you like end up at the same state again。You
    would want these embeddings to be the same however now you're at a different time
    step so like you shifted it so wouldn't that be like harder to learn？

    we losing the Marco property？Because as you said that if we come back to the same

  zh: 所以在你所说的基本上，有一个更大且有趣的问题。我们是否在失去马尔可夫性质？因为如你所说，如果我们在不同的时间步骤回到相同的状态，难道我们不应该执行类似的操作吗？答案是肯定的，我们实际上是非马尔可夫的。这在最开始可能看起来非常反直觉，为什么非马尔可夫性在这里很重要。
- en: and I want to refer to another paper which came very much in conjunction with
    this a transer that actually shows in more detail and its basically says that
    if you were trying to predict the transition dynamics。then you could have actually
    had a Markovvian system built in here， which would do just as good。

  zh: 我想提到另一篇论文，它与这个研究非常相关，实际上更详细地展示了这一点，并且基本上说，如果你试图预测过渡动态，那么你实际上可以在这里构建一个马尔可夫系统，这样效果也会很好。
- en: However， for the perspective of trying to actually predict actions。it does help
    to look at the previous time steps， even more so when you have missing observations
    so for instance。if you have the observations being a subset of the true state
    so looking at the previous states and actions helps you better fill in the missing
    pieces in some sense so this is commonly known as partial observability where
    you by looking at the previous tokens you can do a better job at predicting the
    actions that you should take at the current time step。

  zh: 然而，从实际预测行动的角度来看，考虑之前的时间步骤是有帮助的，尤其是在有缺失观察的情况下。例如，如果你的观察是实际状态的一个子集，那么查看之前的状态和动作可以帮助你更好地填补某种意义上的缺失部分，这通常被称为部分可观察性，通过查看之前的标记，你可以更好地预测在当前时间步骤应采取的行动。
- en: So nonmarkness is on purpose， and it's non intuitive。but I think it's one of
    the things that separates this framework from existing ones。So it will basically
    help you because like RL usually works on like infinite like works better on like
    infinite horizon problems right so technically the way you formulated it it would
    work better on finite horizon problems I'm assuming because you want to take different
    actions based on like a history based on like given the fact that now you have

  zh: 所以非马尔可夫性是故意的，而且是反直觉的。但我认为这是将这个框架与现有框架区分开来的事情之一。因此，它实际上会帮助你，因为强化学习通常在无限问题上表现更好，对吧？从技术上讲，按照你所制定的方式，它在有限问题上表现会更好，我假设是因为你希望根据历史采取不同的行动，考虑到现在你处于不同的时间步骤。
- en: Yeah yeah so if you wanted to work on In Verorizon maybe something like discounting
    would work just as well to get that effect in this case we were using a discount
    factor of one or basically like no discounting at all。but you're right if I think

    ask it anyways。I think I might have missed this or maybe you're about to talk

- en: so we were using the benchmarks that exist for our scenario where essentially
    the way these benchmarks are constructed as。You train an agent using online RL
    and then you look at its replay buffer at some time step。So while training so
    while it's like a medium sort of expert。you collect it the transition its' experience
    so far and make that as the offline data' it's something which is like our framework
    is very agnostic to what offline data that you use so I've not discussed so far
    but make something that in our experiments is based on traditional benchmarks
    got it so the reason I ask isn't I'm sure that your framework can accommodate
    any offline data。

  zh: 所以我们使用的是针对我们场景存在的基准，基本上这些基准的构建方式是。你使用在线强化学习训练一个代理，然后在某个时间步查看它的重放缓冲区。因此，在训练时，作为一种中等水平的专家，你收集了它的转移经验，作为离线数据。我们的框架对你使用的离线数据是非常不敏感的，所以我尚未讨论过，但在我们的实验中是基于传统基准的。明白了，我问的原因并不是因为我不相信你的框架能够容纳任何离线数据。
- en: but it seems to me like the results that you're about to present are going to
    be heavily contingent on what that that data collection policy is。Indeed， indeed，
    and also so we will， I think I have a slide where we show an experiment where
    the amount of data can make a difference in how we compare with baselines and
    essentially we will see how distant transformer especially shines when there is

    defined our model which is going to look at these tra trees and now let's see
    how we train it so very simple we are trying to fill actions。we'll try to match

- en: 😊，Um。But there is something very deep in here for our research。which is that
    these objectives are very stable to train and easily regularize because they've

- en: And those end up being much harder to optimize and scale。and that's why you
    see a lot of the variance in the results as well。Okay so this is how we train
    the model now how do we use the model and that's the point about trying to do
    rollouts for the model so here again this is going to be similar to doing an autoregressive
    generation there was an important token here which was the returns to go。

  zh: 而这些最终会变得更难以优化和扩展。这就是你看到结果中存在很多差异的原因。好的，那么这是我们训练模型的方式，现在我们如何使用模型，这就涉及到为模型进行回放的问题，这里将类似于自回归生成，其中一个重要的标记是“未来回报”。
- en: And what we need to set during evaluation， presumably we want export level performance
    because that will have the highest returns。so we set the initial returns to go。Not

- en: so we will set it to the expatory term for instance。So in code what this whole
    procedure would look like is basically you set this returns to go token to as
    some target return and you set your initial state to one from the environment
    distribution of initial states。

  zh: 所以我们会将其设置为暴露项。例如，在代码中，这整个过程的样子基本上是将这个回报标记设置为某个目标回报，并将初始状态设置为来自初始状态分布的一个。
- en: And then you just roll out your decision transformer。So you get a new action。this
    action will also give you a state and reward from the environment。you append them
    to your sequence and you get a new returns to go and you take just the context
    and key because that's what's used by the transformer to making predictions and
    then field it back to the distant transformer。So it's regular auto regressive
    generation， but the only key point to notice is how you initialize the transformer
    for RL。

  zh: 然后你只是推出你的决策变换器。这样你就得到了一个新的动作。这个动作也会给你环境中的状态和奖励。你将它们附加到你的序列中，你得到新的回报，并且只取上下文和关键，因为这是变换器用来做出预测的，然后将其反馈给远程变换器。所以这是常规的自回归生成，但要注意的关键点是你如何为强化学习初始化变换器。
- en: So add one question here。So how much is it choice on the expert target written
    method。is it does it have to be like the mean expert reward or can it be like
    the maximum reward possible in demand？

- en: 😊，Like， does that try of the number really matter？That's a very good question。so
    we generally would set it to be slightly higher than the max return in the data
    so I think the fact that we use was 1。1 times， but I think we have done a lot
    of experimentation in the range and it's fairly robust to what choice you use。So
    for example， for hopper export returns about 3600 and we have found very stable
    performance from all the way from like 30。

- en: 5400 to even going to very high numbers like 5000 it works。嗯。Yeah， so however。I
    would want to point out that this is something which is not typically needed in
    regular RL like knowing the exposure return here we are actually going beyond
    regular Rl and that we can choose a return we want so we also actually need this
    information about what the exposure return is。

    cannot be on the regular oil， but I'm curious about。Do you also like restrict
    this framework to only offline oil cost。If you wanna run this kind of framework

- en: But remains to be seen how well this trend can be made consistent across environments。Can
    I jump in with a question。Yes， so I think that last point is really interesting
    and it's cool that you guys occasionally see it。I'm curious to know what happens。So
    this is all condition you give as an input。what return you would like and it tries
    to select a sequence of actions that gives it。

  zh: 但仍需观察这个趋势在不同环境中能否保持一致。我可以插入一个问题吗？是的，所以我觉得最后一点非常有趣，你们偶尔看到这个真不错。我很好奇会发生什么。所以这都是你作为输入给出的条件。你想要什么回报，它就会尝试选择一系列能够提供的行动。
- en: I'm curious to know what happens if you just give it ridiculous inputs like
    for example。you know here here the order of magnitude for the return is like 50
    to 100。What happens if you put in 10000。Good question and this is something we
    tried early on I don't want to say if we went up to 10000 but we try like really
    high returns which not even an expert could get and generally we see this leveling
    performance so you can see hints of it in half Che arm and you know pong as well
    or Walker to some extent that if you look at the very end things start saturating。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我很好奇，如果你给它一些荒谬的输入会发生什么，比如说，你知道这里的回报数量级大概是50到100。如果你输入10000会怎样？好问题，这是我们早期尝试过的事情。我不想说我们是否尝试过10000，但我们确实尝试过一些很高的回报，这连专家都无法获得，通常我们会看到这种性能水平的现象，所以你可以在Half
    Cheetah和Pong等游戏中看到一些迹象，或者在Walker中，在你观察最后时刻时，事情开始饱和。
- en: 😊，So if you exceed what is like certain threshold which often corresponds with
    the best tragic threshold。but not always beyond that everything is similar returns
    so it's not that it so at least one good thing is it does not degrade in performance
    so it would have been a little bit worrying if you specified a return of 10000
    and gives you return which is。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 😊，所以如果你超过了某个阈值，这个阈值通常对应于最佳的回报阈值，但并不总是如此，超出这一点后，所有的回报都是相似的。因此至少有一点好事是，它的性能不会退化，所以如果你指定一个10000的回报而得到的回报是这样的，那就会有点令人担忧。
- en: Train0 or something really new。So it's good that it stabilizes。but it's not
    that it keeps increasing on and on， so there would be a point where the performance
    would get saturated。Okay， thank you。I was also curious like so usually for transfer
    models you need a lot of data。so do you know how well like like how much data
    do you need like how where does it scale the data the performance？
  id: totrans-88
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Train0或其他一些新的东西。所以稳定化是好的，但这并不是说它会持续不断地增加，因此会有一个点，性能会达到饱和。好的，谢谢。我也很好奇，通常对于迁移模型，你需要很多数据。那么你知道需要多少数据吗？数据的规模和性能之间的关系是什么？
- en: Yeah， so here we use。The standard。UmData like the D4 RL benchmarks for Mexico。which
    I think have million u transitions in the order of millions。For。Atari。we used
    one person of the replay buffer， which is smaller than the one we used for the
    Mujoco benchmarks。and I actually have a result in the very next slide which shows
    dis transformer especially being useful when you have a little data。
  id: totrans-89
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 是的，所以在这里我们使用了标准的数据，比如D4RL的墨西哥基准，我认为有数百万的转移数据。对于Atari，我们使用了重放缓冲区中的一部分，这个规模小于我们用于Mujoco基准的数据。我在下一张幻灯片中有一个结果，显示了在数据较少时，变换器特别有用。
- en: So yeah， so I guess one question to ask before you move on。In the last slide。what
    do you mean again by return conditioning for like the multitask part？Yeah。so if
    you think about the returns to go at test time。the one you feed have to feed in
    as the starting token。As one girl。Specifying what policy you want。
  id: totrans-90
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以是的，我想在你继续之前问一个问题。在上一张幻灯片中，你再次提到的多任务部分的回报条件是什么意思？是的，所以如果你考虑测试时的目标回报，你必须作为起始标记输入的那一个。作为一个标记，指定你想要的策略。
- en: 喂。How is that multit？So it's multitask in the sense that because you can get
    different policies by changing your target return to go。you're essentially getting
    different behaviors encoded so think about for instance a hopper and you specify
    a return to go that's really low。
  id: totrans-91
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 喂，这样的多任务怎么理解？所以它是多任务，因为你可以通过改变目标回报来获得不同的策略，实质上是在编码不同的行为。例如，想象一个跳跃者，你指定一个非常低的目标回报。
- en: So you're basically saying， get me an agent which will just stick around its
    initial state。And not going into unchared territory。And if you give it really，
    really high。then you're asking it to do the traditional task， which is to hop
    and go as far as possible without falling but can you qualify those multitask
    because that basically just means that your return conditioning is a cue for it
    to memorize right which is usually like one of the pitfalls of multitask。
  id: totrans-92
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以你基本上是说，给我一个代理，它只会停留在初始状态，而不会进入未知领域。如果你给它非常非常高的目标回报，那么你要求它执行的传统任务就是跳跃并尽可能远地移动而不摔倒，但你能否对那些多任务进行量化，因为这基本上意味着你的回报条件是它记忆的提示，对吧？这通常是多任务的一个陷阱。
- en: So I'm not sure if it's a task identifier， that's what I'm trying to say。So
    I'm not sure if it's memorization because like I think the purpose of this。I mean。like
    having an offline data set that's fixed is basically saying that it's very。very
    specific to if you had the same start state and you took the same actions and
    you had the same target fair turns。
  id: totrans-93
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以我不确定这是否是任务标识符，这正是我想说的。我不确定这是否是记忆化，因为我认为这个目的。就是说，拥有一个固定的离线数据集基本上是在说，如果你有相同的起始状态并采取相同的动作，并且有相同的目标公平收益，这将是非常特定的。
- en: that would qualify as memorization。But here at test time we allow all of these
    things to change and in fact they do change so your initial state would be different。your
    target return it could be very could be a different scalar than one you ever saw
    during training。
  id: totrans-94
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这将被视为记忆化。但在测试时，我们允许所有这些东西发生变化，实际上它们确实会变化，所以你的初始状态会不同，目标收益可能与训练期间看到的完全不同。
- en: It yeah and so so essentially the model has to learn to generate that behavior
    starting from a different initial state and maybe a different value of the target
    return than it saw during during during training if the dynamics are stochastic
    that also makes so that even if you memorize the actions you're not guaranteed
    to get the next the same next state。
  id: totrans-95
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 是的，因此本质上模型必须学习在不同的初始状态和目标收益值下生成该行为，这与训练期间看到的情况可能不同。如果动态是随机的，即使你记住了动作，也不能保证得到相同的下一个状态。
- en: so you would actually have a bad correlation with the performance of the dynamics
    are also stochastic。Also， I was very curious how much time does it take to train
    business transformer？In general。So it takes about a few hours， so I want to say
    like about。45 hours。Depending on what quality GPU use， but yeah thats that's a
    reasonable estimate y call it thanks。Okay。
  id: totrans-96
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以你实际上会与动态性能有不良相关性，因为动态也是随机的。另外，我很好奇训练商业变换器需要多少时间？一般来说，大约需要几个小时，我想说大约是45小时。这取决于使用的GPU质量，但这是一个合理的估计。
- en: so actually while doing this experiment， this project。we thought of a baseline
    which we were surprised as not there in previously traditional on offine RL but
    makes very much sense and we thought we should also think about whether decision
    transformers are actually doing something very similar that baseline and the baseline
    is what we call as person behavioral cloning。

  zh: 所以实际上在进行这个实验和项目时，我们想到了一个基线，我们很惊讶在之前的传统离线RL中并不存在，但它非常有意义，我们还想考虑决策变换器是否在做一些类似的事情，而这个基线我们称之为个人行为克隆。
- en: So behavioral clo， what it does is basically it ignores the returns。And simply
    imitates the agent looking by just trying to map the actions given the current
    states。This is not a good idea with an offline inter set which will have project
    trees of both low returns and high returns。So traditional vehicle cloning， it's
    common to see that as a baseline in offline Ral methods and it is unless you have
    a very high quality data set。

  zh: 行为克隆的作用基本上是忽略收益，简单地通过尝试映射当前状态下的动作来模仿代理。这在离线数据集上不是一个好主意，因为它会有低收益和高收益的项目树。传统的车辆克隆，通常被视为离线RL方法的基线，除非你拥有非常高质量的数据集。
- en: does it is not a good baseline for offline RL。However， there is a version that
    we call as Per BC。which actually makes quite a lot of sense and in this version。We
    filter out the top tra trees from our offline set。once stop the ones which have
    the highest rewards。

    trees and you take the tra trees with the highest returns and keep a certain percentage

    uses especially when it's used in the form of behavioral planning。it uses supervised

- en: Oh。So。And what we find actually that for the moderate and highal regimes。the
    recent transform is actually very comparable to Pu and VC so it's a very strong
    baseline which I think all the future work in offline Rs should include there's
    actually an eyeC submission from last week which has a much more detailed analysis

    eyeC 文章对此基线进行了更详细的分析，这在本论文中有所介绍。
- en: And。What we do find is that for low data regimes the dis transformer does much
    better than person behavioral clo。so this is for the Atari benchmarks where like
    I previously mentioned we have a much smaller data set。As compared to the Mojoko
    environments， and here we find that for even after varying the different fraction

- en: So 10% DCc basically means that we filter out and keep the top 10% of the trajectories
    if you go even lower then the start data set becomes fairly small so the baseline
    become meaningless。But for even the reasonable ranges， we'd never find the performance
    matching that of the transformers for these Atari benchmarks。

    Atari 基准测试中的表现。
- en: 呃的铁 I may。So I notice in table three， for example， which is not this table with
    one just before in the paper。there's a report on the CQL performance， which to
    me also feels you know intuitively pretty similar to the percent BC in the sense
    of like you pick trajectories you know performing well and you try and stay roughly

  zh: 这是状态空间分布。我对此感到好奇。你是否知道 CQL 性能相对于这里的百分比 BC 性能如何？

    of pessimism where you want to pick trajectories where you're more confident in

    with CQL on this table。

- en: but if you look at the detailed results for Atring。Then I think should they
    should have the SQL for sure because that's the numbers we are reporting here
    so I can tell you what the sQL performance is actually pretty good and it's very
    competitive。When the decision transformer for aary？So this TD learning baseline

- en: And apologize apologize if this was mentioned， I just missed it。but if you have
    the sense that this is basically like a failure of CQL to be able to extrapolate
    well or sort of stitch together different parts of trajectories。Whereas a decision
    transformer can sort of make that extrapolation between you have like the first
    half of one trajectory is really good the second half of one trajectory is really
    good so you can actually piece those together a decision transformer where you
    can't necessarily do that with CQL because the path connecting those may not necessarily
    be well covered by the behavior policy。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果之前提到过，我表示歉意，我只是错过了。但是如果你有感觉，这基本上是CQL在外推方面的失败，或者说在拼接轨迹的不同部分时存在问题。而决策变换器能够进行这种外推，比如第一段轨迹非常好，第二段轨迹也很好，因此可以将它们拼接起来，而CQL可能做不到，因为连接这些的路径可能未被行为策略良好覆盖。
- en: Yeah， yeah， so and this actually goes to one of the intuitions which I did not
    emphasize too much。but we have a discussion on the paper where essentially why
    do we expect a transformer or any model for that matter to look at offline data
    that's suboptimal and get something a policy which generates optimal loadouts？

    behaviors from suboptimal trajectories and that stitching could perhaps lead to
    a behavior that was better than anything you saw in individual tra trees in your

    that's really our hope also that something that will transformers very good at

- en: which when stitch together would give you optimal optimal behavior。So。And it's
    very much possible that is something unique to this in transformers and something
    like CQL would not be able to do person BCC because it's filtering out the data
    is automatically being limited and not being able to do that because those segments
    of good behavior could be in trajectories which overall do not have a high return。
  id: totrans-113

  zh: 当拼接在一起时，会给出最优的行为。所以，很可能这在变换器中是独特的，而像CQL这样的模型可能做不到，因为它过滤掉的数据是自动限制的，无法进行这样的操作，因为这些良好行为的片段可能出现在整体回报不高的轨迹中。
- en: but so if you filter them out， you are losing all of that information。Okay。so
    I said there is hyperparameter the context in K and like with most of perception。one
    of the big advantages of transformers opposed to other sequence models like LSTMs
    is that they can process really large sequences。And here at a first glance， it
    might seem that being Markcoan would have been helpful for RL。

- en: which also was a question that was raised earlier。so we did this experiment
    where we did compare performance with context and K equals1 and here we had context

    this in transformformer。which is very simple， there was no slide I had which was
    going into the details of dynamic programming。which is the crux of most R， this
    was just pure supervised learning in an autoregressive framework that was getting
    us as good performance。嗯。What about cases where this approach actually starts
    outperforming some of the traditional methods are so to probe a little bit further
    we start looking at sparse reward environments and basically we just took our
    existing mojoku environments and then instead of giving it the information for
    reward for every transition we fed it the cumulative reward at the end of the
    trajectory so every transition will have a zero reward except the very end where
    you get the entire reward at once it's a very sparse reward perform scenario for
    that reason。

  zh: 获取良好性能非常重要。好的。那么到目前为止，我给你展示了变换器中的这些内容，这非常简单，我没有哪一张幻灯片是深入探讨动态编程的，而动态编程是大多数R的关键，这只是纯粹的监督学习，在自回归框架下取得了良好的性能。嗯。那么在什么情况下这种方法实际上开始超越一些传统方法呢？所以为了进一步探讨，我们开始研究稀疏奖励环境，基本上我们只是拿现有的mojoku环境，然后不是为每个过渡提供奖励信息，而是在轨迹结束时给予累计奖励，所以每个过渡的奖励为零，只有在最后才能一次性获得全部奖励，这就是一个非常稀疏奖励的表现场景。
- en: And here we find that。哦。Compared to the original denses results， the delayed
    results for Dt。they will deteriorate a little bit， which is expected because now
    you are withholding some of the more fine grain information at every time step。but
    the drop is。Not too significant compared to the original E performance here。whereas
    for something like CQL there is a drastic drop in performance so CQL suffers quite
    a lot in sparse reward scenarios。

  zh: 在这里我们发现，哦。与原始密集结果相比，DT的延迟结果会稍微恶化，这是意料之中的，因为现在你在每个时间步骤都 withholding了一些更细粒度的信息，但与原始E性能相比，下降并不太显著。而对于CQL这样的算法，性能下降非常明显，所以CQL在稀疏奖励场景中受到了很大的影响。
- en: but the distant transformer does more。And just for completeness if you also
    have performance of behavioral training and person behavioral clo。which because
    they don't look at reward information。except maybe person BC looks at only for
    preprocessing the data set。these are agnostic to whether the environments as spa

    agent will pick up the key and then they do it replaced in an empty room。And in
    phase three。it will be placed in a room at the door where it will actually use
    the key that it collected in phase one if it did to open the door。😊，So essentially

    you want to see the future rewards so I mean it's just going to predict the return

    returns to go if it pick up the K。But in in the plot you， you know， in the key

    like usually a hypopenimeter like。You don't have a fixed gamma so do you think
    like can you also like learn this thing and could this also be like。can you have
    a different gamma for each gesture or something， possibly？

  zh: 明白了。是的，我在阅读距离变换工作时也想到了有趣的事情。你没有固定的伽玛，伽玛通常是一个超参数。你没有固定的伽玛，所以你认为可以学习这个吗？这是否可能？你能否为每个手势有不同的伽玛？
- en: That would be interesting actually， I had not thought of that。but maybe learning
    to predict the discount factor could be another extension of this work。😊，Also。do
    you think like this like a decision transformer work is like like is it compatible
    with Q learning so if you have something like EQL stuff like that。can you also
    implement those sort of loss functions？😊，On top of a decision transformer。

  zh: 这实际上会很有趣，我之前没有想到过。但也许学习预测折扣因子可以是这项工作的另一个扩展。😊，你认为这种决策变压器的工作与 Q 学习兼容吗？如果你有像 EQL
    这样的东西，你也可以实现这些损失函数吗？😊，在决策变压器之上。
- en: So I think maybe I could imagine ways in which you could encode pessimism in
    here as well。which is key to how CQL works， and actually most of oftenal algorithms
    work。including the model based ones。Our focus here deliberately was to go out
    is simplicity because we feel that part of the reason why oural literature has
    been so scattered as well if you think about different sub problems that everyone
    tries to solve has been because everyone's tried to。

  zh: 所以我想，也许我可以想象在这里编码悲观主义的方法，这对 CQL 的工作原理至关重要，实际上大多数算法也是如此，包括基于模型的那些。我们在这里故意关注简单性，因为我们认为，散乱的学术文献部分原因在于，大家都试图解决不同的子问题。
- en: 😊，Pick up on IDOs which are very well suited for that narrow problem like for
    example。you have whether you're doing offline or you're doing online or you're
    doing imitation。you're doing multitals and all these different variants。And so
    by design， we did not we were very。we did not want to incorporate exactly the
    components that exist in the current algorithms because then it just where it
    starts looking more like。

  zh: 😊，关注 IDOs，它们非常适合解决像你在线或离线、模仿、进行多任务等各种不同变体的问题。因此，我们的设计并没有想要直接包含当前算法中的确切组件，因为那样看起来就会更像是架构的变化，而不是更概念性的变化，转向思考
    RS 序列建模。非常一般地说，是的，就这样。
- en: Architecture change that opposed to a more conceptual change engine to thinking
    about RS sequence modeling。Very generally。cor it， yeah just。So do you think like
    we can use some sort of like like3 learning objectives instead of supervised learning？

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你认为我们可以使用某种像 3 学习目标而不是监督学习吗？
- en: 诶。It's possible and maybe like I'm saying that for certain like for online RL，
    it might be necessary。😊，Of， we were happy to see it was not necessary。But it remains
    to be seen more generally for a transformer model or any other model for that
    matter。encompassing R more broadly whether that becomes a necessity。哦也。Well， thanks
    for your time。this was great。

  zh: 诶，这可能是的，也许我说，对于某些情况，比如在线 RL，这可能是必要的。😊，不过，我们很高兴看到它并不是必需的。但对于变压器模型或其他模型是否变得必要，仍需进一步观察。哦，也好。感谢你的时间，这真是太好了。
